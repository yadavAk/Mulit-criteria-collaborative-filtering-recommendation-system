<Content>Came for the conference, stayed for the shopping Really nice hotel - great, extensive breakfast and 10-15 mins walking distance to the Silk Road shopping center if you're so inclined. Service was great. My glasses broke and the 'hotel engineer' tended to them for 30 minutes to fix them. The result was complete carnage but he was very friendly and dedicated.Rooms are large and have the rare and wonderful feature of a shower that doesn't spray you with cold water when you turn it on - because it faces away from the entrance. Sounds simple but is rare enough to be noticeable.I stayed at the Beijing Hilton during this stay and enjoyed this hotel more. It was very pleasant, and if you have a conference at the venue, don't hesitate to stay here.

<Content>Great hotel in Beijing We stayed at the China World hotel in Beijing for 9 days. The hotel is run by the Shangri-La chain, and it is up to their typical excellent standards. The public areas are opulent. The room was good sized and had very good amenities, but it was not as large or opulent as a room we had on the same trip at the Pudong Shangri-La in Shanghai. The hotel staff was very good and had the best English language skills we encountered in any hotel in China. The China World is part of the China World Center that includes a couple of office towers, the Trader's Hotel (also run by Shangri-La and bit less expensive) and the China World shopping mall which is filled with designer stores from Euorpe and the US and also has several restaurants. We tried several restaurants in the China World mall; South Beauty and Royal Food were by far the best. Only one glitch in our stay: We sent our laundry and dry cleaning and some of the laundry came back stained or over bleached; a surprising mistake for such a good hotel.

<Content>Quintessential Luxurious Chinese Experience I loved this hotel. The service was exceptional while being very humble. All my request were met and exceeded. The lobby is rich, without being over the top. I especially enjoyed the live music each night in the lobby. I did manage to try a few of the restaurants. The Chinese restaurant is very tradititional. I loved the Mediteranian restaurant. I would definitely stay at China World Hotel again and again. Of coarse, it's a Shangri-La Hotel...

<Content>Well located luxury business hotel The China World Hotel is a well run, well maintained and very well located business hotel in the Chaoyang district of Beijing. I had arranged an airport transfer through the hotel, and was pleasantly surprised to see a hotel representative waiting for me at the end of the jetway after the long flight from the US. She walked with me through the terminal to immigration, then to baggage claim and finally to the carpark to meet the hotel driver. This was about as smooth and effortless as an airport transfer can be. The hotel itself has a grand and spacious lobby, with a swift and efficient reception desk. The desk clerks were friendly and were fluent in English. My luggage arrived in my room just moments after I did. The room itself was well laid out, with a spacious work area, laptop sized safe, sitting area and fridge. The bathroom included a large shower and separate bathtub with good lighting. They also provide complementary fresh fruit and bottled water each day. The internet access was easy to configure, though expensive (140 RMB/day) given the overall price level in Beijing. The breakfast buffet offers many western and Chinese choices, but is expensive The location is terrific for tourists, as the hotel sits atop a subway stop (Guamao), from which one can easily get to Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City and other tourist sites. It's also a short walk to the Silk Street market, which is a must for shopping for souvenirs, t-shirts, knock offs, silk pajamas, etc. Be prepared to haggle.

<Content>Great hotel I absolutely loved this hotel. Stayed here for a week on business recently and found this to be an excellent business hotel. The gym is one of the finest I've ever encountered in a hotel, the rooms are well-equipped and nicely designed. I loved the soft modern bed after a rock slab in Hong Kong. The staff are all incredibly nice, though not always helpful. The concierge couldn't recommend a tailor outside the ultra-expensive mall nest door, for example. I never knew that I needed someone to push the up button on the elevator, but it was nice to always have a warm greeting. The cafe restaurant has a grand breakfast buffet, but it's very pricey at about $40. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.

<Content>Nice but over priced The hotel is nice and comfortable, but is quite over priced for what it is as there are other choices nearby. We ate at the hotel's Italian restaurant. The menu looked attractive. But the taste was not what it claimed for. The wine selection was impressive. It seemed there were more locals trying to impress other locals here. The evening dinner buffet was quite nice with great selections, but choice than the wester restaurant. It's location is convenient. If you have meetings after meetings within a day, it's a nice and easy place for people to come to meet you here so you don't have to fight the Beijing traffic.

<Content>Wonderful hotel but very expensive This hotel is definitely luxurious but it鈥榮 to be expected for the steep prices. Great beds, soft sheets, towel placed on the floor by your bed with soft slippers. Huge bathroom has both a deep tub and powerful shower. The rooms are quiet and the street noise can鈥檛 be heard. Helpful tip: If you order a wake up call, they will deliver coffee or tea to your door along with the call. The work out area is big and looks well equipped. The pool is a lap pool; not suitable for children. But it鈥檚 a great pool for adult swimming. There are segregated hot (and cold) tubs in the changing rooms. The breakfast is varied with just about every kind of food imaginable. We had access to the Horizon lounge, with breakfast. Like previous posts, there were not enough tables for breakfast or for evening cocktails. The breakfast selection in the lounge is much more limited than in the main breakfast area. The evening refreshments food was fresh and inviting. The security in the hotel was tight, since the Olympic Committee was having meetings in the hotel at the time. Can recommend this hotel but not for travelers on a strict budget.

<Content>Great hotel if you like them big and luxurious When I stayed at the China World Hotel 10 years ago it was not a Shangri-La, which it now is. This time I stayed in a suit room which was absolutely super. The VIP limousine service from the airport was very efficient and welcoming. The gym and pool really nice, and the massage I took in the spa in the middle of the night was lovely. However, the Horizon lounge was a disappointment at least comparing with the Shangri-La in Bangkok. Not enough tables for breakfast and happy hour. It's a really nice hotel, but in my opinion it's not really worth the money. Stay there if the location is right for you (VERY heavy traffic), if you like big hotels, and if someone else is picking up the bill (or if you have more money than you know what to do with).

<Content>I recommend this hotel 100%! We live in the suburbs of Beijing and recently had our staff Christmas Party at the China World Hotel, so decided to stay at their hotel for the night. Everything was absolutely fabulous!Great central location - close to everything (with the subway station located right next door)! Fantastic breakfast buffet, brunch buffet and truly the best dim sum restaurant in town. Everything at this hotel is first class and they offer many promotion specials so you often can get a great rate. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a first-rate hotel in Beijing!

<Content>Fantastic Hotel My first trip to Beijing was a business trip. Stayed at the China World Hotel at the recommendation of the business colleagues that I was visiting in Beijing. Wow...what a hotel. I wasn't sure what to expect, but this turned out to be one of the nicest hotels I've ever had the pleasure to stay in. The single King Room was large, even by American standards and was warm with lots of wood trim and art work in the room. The service was thoughtful and unobtrusive...nightly turn-down, slippers by the bed, bottles of drinking water (complementary) were placed by the bed and in the bathroom. The bath was large featured shower and separate tub. The lobby and the common areas of the hotel were beautiful, even if they were bustling with people most of the time. Live grand piano music filled the lobby -- a nice treat.Most enjoyable of all was the morning breakfast buffet. There were multiple stations in the buffet enabling any type of cuisine one wanted to sample...from traditional American bacon and eggs, to European to Oriental. Very well done. With the help of the local business contacts - who booked our rooms for us --all of this cost about the same price as a low-end business hotel in the States. The hotel is connected to a high end shopping mall, for strolls among Versacci and Louis Vuitton, if that is your thing.

<Content>Safety Concern On 11 Dec I visited my business guest at China World Hotel at 12 noon. While we were walking towards the Aria restaurant at the lobby, suddenly we were being pushed and ordered by a jecket male to clear. My guest and I were shocked. Before we could react, we were being pushed by another leather jacket male. We were concerned about our safety and decided not to have lunch and hurried back to my buisness guest suite room. Later the General Manager came to apologize and explained to my guest that there were a group of politicians behind us walking the lobby passage and the two male who pushed us were not hotel staff but politicians' staff. I felt strongly that our safety was being compromised in this hotel. Hence, if you are not a political figure be prepared to be physically (even you are a female) pushed around ignoring your safety not once but twice in this hotel.

<Content>illumious as Jade The entrance to the hotel is impressive, we were escorted to our room and checked in in our suite. The staff is remarkable and very attentative. The hotel sits atop some of the best shopping for western goods. The pearl market is not far from the hotel. The forbidden city is only walkable, if you are in type top shape. Their is a subway stop right outside of the hotel. The room was very comfortable and 5 stars to the shower and the deluxe pressure. The only negative is that the eating at the hotel is extremely expensive. To get a cup of coffee on the club level required 2 workers and a wait of 10-15 mintues. The breakfast had some great dim sum. The gym is also 5 star. I would stay again.

<Content>Top of the World! This place is your typical Shangri-la property - All class and high service levels consistently across every area. Check-in was very personal and we were escorted to our room and shown around.The Golden Circle membership doesn'r seen to have any impact until you stay for a while by the looks of it - the room was OK but pretty standard (at A$400++).Speaking of the room, it too was OK but there are better Shang's around. Stayed in HK a week before at the Shangri-la and that was another notch up.Overall, a wickedly expensive place to stay and an enjoyable place.

<Content>Excellent hotel for business travellers I stayed here on business for 3 weeks July-August 2007, with a room on the 18th floor (Horizon Club floor, for which you get Internet access and breakfast included in the price).I arrived at the hotel in the morning after a long flight from the UK and received a warm personal welcome. The lobby immediately strikes you with its great opulence. I have to say I didn't tire of it after three weeks.The room was very spacious, with effective air conditioning. The carpet was clearly not new but it didn't really look worn in any way. All the fittings in the room and the beautiful marble bathroom were really well maintained and showed no signs of use at all. I also particularly enjoyed the large window overlooking Beijing; this was particularly effective during the handful of thunderstorms we had during my stay, for watching the lightning!I really only ate breakfast at the hotel, and that was wonderful. There is surely something to suit all tastes. The only slight criticism I have is that, being myself a hardened tea-drinker, it was sometimes difficult to get a top-up of tea in the morning. Also one Sunday morning I got to breaksfast at around 9am and it was completely full, which meant I had to wait a few minutes for a table. They appeared to be running out of a couple of items as well. But this experience was not repeated any other morning.I used room service a couple of times, and while this seemed rather expensive, it was excellently presented and warm. I only used one of the hotel restaurants on one occasion (the Summer Palace Chinese restaurant) and I wasn't all that impressed with the food, especially given the price compared with what's available outside the hotel, which can be really good quality. So I can't really recommend this hotel restaurant.I made good use of the extensive gym. There is a lot of equipment which guests can use free of charge. If you want to burn off some pounds from too much Chinese food this is the place to go. Free towels and bottled water are available. I didn't use the swimming pool despite my best intentions.I particularly liked the free shoe shine service, which I used several times.If you are on one of the Horizon Club floors you have free use of the Horizon Lounge. I used this a few times; on my first couple of visits the staff in there were very attentive, however, this seemed to change overnight, and I made a couple of visits where they completely ignored me. This is not the level of service I would have expected.There are all the usual luxury western shops in the shopping mall below the hotel but I didn't use any of these; the prices seem no different from home so I couldn't see the point. Instead I recommend you polish your bargaining skills at the nearby silk market!

The choice of food for breakfast and lunch is great, catering to various tastes for each ethnic background which exceeds the usual standard in Asian Hotels of that category. The rooms are huge as well as the bathrooms which have all amenities you can wish for. I ordered room service a couple of times which was fast, friendly and the quality of the food was great (mostly Asian).The Hotel has great facilities for meetings, and the bell captains make sure that you get around in the city and get back safely.Also, I ordered a pick up from the airport which I can really recommend. It worked out great and they awaited me right at the gate upon arrival and walked me through immigration. Overall, its an ideal place to stay and

<Content>Decent room, but poor service This is quite a large hotel with attached shopping complex. The room I stayed in was decent in terms of its decor and amenities. For the size of the hotel, the room was comparable to most 4-star hotel rooms found in Las Vegas with a comfortable bed, and a comfortable bathroom. However, the service received in the lobby bar and from the doorman was less desirable. On several occasions I was left to wonder if the service staff were not comprehending English, or if they were just rude and didn't care one way or the other. This may be a good hotel for business travelers who don't plan to spend much time there, because it is close to the convention center, but definitely not for vacation travelers.

<Content>Stay Away Stay away from this hotel. Everything went downhill after we got into our room. The room was old; extreme wore carpet and needed major renovations. The hotel鈥檚 webpage advertised that they spent 30 millions in upgrade in 2003. Obviously all 30 millions went to fixing up the lobby and 0 dollars in their rooms. Not a 5 stars property, more like your local motels.

<Content>Look for an other place If you like to stay at a hotel with very bad service, tasteless rooms and pay about 350 euro a night, please go the China World Hotel. At first look the entrance looks chique, but after 15 minutes it becomes quite dull and all gold platter. We checked in in this hotel, and had to bring our luggage to our rooms ourselves. This I don't mind normally so much, but we had just a lot of luggage and paid really - for China - a ridiculious amount for a night. The room was totally boring, and not even met our reservation.It's really just a business hotel, although newly decorated, it remains a very boring and tasteless place. People at the reception are unqualified for the job, I would say, with these prices.If you have or want to stay here, please go ahead. If you like to get value for your money, and have a nice stay, go somewhere else. I've also been to the Shangrila hotel, and that's a very nice hotel. The same chain, but much nicer rooms and better service. That's the only other hotel I've been in Beijing, so I can't recommend an other hotel.

<Content>Excellent business hotel! I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in April. While expensive, the hotel is beautiful and great for business travellers. The standard room was very spacious with a great marble bathroom and hude semi-circular shower stall. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, making it an effort to get out of bed in the morning. The business centre is one of the most comfortable and inviting centres that I have seen. The food at breakfast and at the Chinese and other restaurants was impeccable. The Aria bar was an excellent place to meet for a drink, sometimes well into the night! All in all, from the high activity levels at the hotel, it is obvious that this is the hotel of choice for business travellers in Beijing.

<Content>Great Perks I stayed 5 nights on business for US$180/night, this is great value. Some of the great perks: (a) get a massage at Jing Chen on Level B2, a spa that is luxurious even by US standards. 18 foot ceilings, sunk baths, beautiful massive carved doors and excellent therapists (only US$60 for a 1 hour massage); (b) Sunday afternoon tea features live performance from soprano and tenor opera singers and a small full orchestra (in fact, live music daily in the lobby); (c) hotel breakfast is crappy, but DO NOT miss the Starbucks just a few steps round the corner one level down in the adjoining mall (Starbucks is actually a bit cheaper in Beijing than US and just as good); (d) the hotel is connected to a vast underground mall - skip the Louis Vuitton stores and head for the cheap sushi parlors, Sephora (if you forgot some toiletries, department stores, bookshop(with limited English books), etc.' (e) Aria restaurant in the hotel is rated very highly by Frommer's as one of Beijing's best Western restaurants, and it is true, so if you are pining for a standard new American/French type cuisine, you cannot go wrong here. Prices are same as in a five star US restaurant, but believe me if you are homesick...(f)lastly, I like how the rooms are quite large, I like the heavenly bed (like Westin), and how the room comes replete with every conceivable amenity (open all the drawers and you will find electronic safe, electric teapot, full stationery set (with staplers!) and excellent - fast - broadband connection (cable provided) at US$20 for 24 hours.

<Content>This hotel has become a high-turnover volume shop... I am writing this from the business center on the 3rd floor of the hotel. I have stayed here about 8 times over the past 5 years - 4 times within this past year alone.Service in this hotel has been in decline for some time. The service within the restaurants was not very good. We ate at Aria - a french style restaurant accesible from the lobby and a Japanese restaurant on the 3rd floor - in both restaurants we had to flag down staff several times during the meal to ask for more wine, bread, water, our bill. The Horizon Club (principally located on the 20th floor) has become terrible. The only words spoken by the staff are terse demands for your room number -- not once was I asked whether I wanted anything (fundamental since the tea I wanted can only be provided by a server - no self service). This is truly a high-volume, high-turnover hotel thus perhaps understandable that the staff doesn't care about its guests. If you can handle the location, strongly recommend the Shangri-La Hotel - this is located a distance from financial, commercial areas but is a completely different experence.

<Content>Best in Beijing My wife and I frequently stay at hotels in Beijing to get away from our regular pace. This hotel is our favorite. We book a room on the Horizon club level and only go downstairs to eat meals in the restaurants. We love the food in the club, and could stay up there all day reading a book or spending time together. The food in the club is great, and the service is wonderful. I would say though, that the rooms feel a bit dark because of all the dark wood paneling. Highly recommend the Dinner buffet in the Scene. It's awesome. The chocolate fountain on the buffet is a must, especially if strawberries are in season. And there must be at least 30 other desserts on the buffet as well. We will be going back to this hotel often.

<Content>More business than pleasure On a leisure visit (back in Sept 06) to Beijing, we stayed for 4 nights during our limited time in the city. The hotel is situated in a very commercial part of town, with little character, but is very impressive upon entry. 1. The lobby is pure opulance (at least for China standards) and filled with visiting multinationals and businessmen. There were only a handful of vacationing families during our stay.2. The service, both front desk and concierge, are extremely good and knowledgeable, as one would expect for a business hotel of this stature and location. Check in was a breeze. 3. The room was nicely decorated and large. It seemed well kept and comfortable. Nothing out of the place, as one would expect for a 4+ star hotel.4. There's an adjacent shopping mall. Nothing spectacular and typical of most western boutiques and designer name brands. For real local flavor, try the Silk Market building just a block away. Not much in terms of silk, but loads of knock offs and bargain like crazy.5. Tourist sites like the Summer Palace and Tiananmen square are a short taxi ride away. Get ready to be mobbed by peddlers selling books, postcards and other site specific souvenirs upon taxi exit. We took the subway back to the hotel after visiting the Tiananmen sq. Unlike most major subways systems, this one didn't have automated ticket/token dispenser. One has to deal with a real person who only spoke Chinese.We would certainly stay at China World on return trips. It's only negative would be the overly business atmosphere and clientele. This should not be a problem if one is a business traveller.

<Content>Definitely 'Bliss Bed' heaven After suffering hard beds for 3 weeks in awful hotels I treated myself to a 3 day stay in this hotel based on the comments on this site. I admit I was a little bit worried because one of the reviewers stated that it was showing its age and I was paying quite a bit of money to stay here. But it was magnificent. The bed was truly heaven - I didnt want to get out of it! I was not particularly impressed with the staff on reception (but what a lobby!!!). And the location was not particularly good - mainly due to all the construction going on around. But that is to be expected in a city preparing for the Olympic Games and I was truly able to forgive. The bathroom is just fantastic and the toiletries really nice and substantial size. Prices in the mini bar a bit high and meals (room service) ditto but I honestly cannot say enough about how much I loved staying here and I did not regret it one bit. If I ever go back to Beijing I would probably stay there again, but make sure it is booked on the Internet as it is cheaper than rack rate (I know because I tried to stay an extra night and nearly died when they said how much it woild cost).

<Content>Fantastic Hotel We spent three nights here in October 2006 and it was a fantastic experience. This hotel is as clean and modern as anything you would find in New York or London. The lobby was one of the nicest (and largest) that I have ever seen. The rooms were quite large and the bathrooms were great - large and modern. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and very proficient in English. At one point, I requested a transformer so that I could charge my camera and it was in my room within 10 minutes. There was a health club and swimming pool but we did not use either. However, we walked through and they both appeared to be really nice - especially the whirlpool. The buffet restaurant was excellent - Chinese, Japanese, and American dishes were all available. The hotel is located a few miles east of Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City and is just a ten minute walk from Silk Alley. There is also a subway station located right in front of the hotel for those who feel adventurous.

<Content>Elegant and Grand My wife and I spent 3 nights at the China World Hotel after 2 nights in the Crowne Plaza. Even though we preferred the Crowne Plaza slightly, the China World is a great hotel which I thoroughly recommend.The only real problem with the China World is that its a little too big and impersonal. While we found the Crowne Plaza to be friendly and warm, the China World felt a little like a railway station. A very nice railway station, but still....First of all it has to be said that the lobby is very beautiful. On the Sunday there was a 30 piece orchestra playing classical pops which kinda blew us away. The marble, carpets, chandeliers are all very impressive. The rooms are very comfortable (we had a standard King), especially the bed which was probably one of the most comfortable beds i've ever slept in. The room is very large (bigger than the Crowne Plaza rooms) and very well kept. The bathroom is huge and had an enormous shower and seperate bath. Broadband Internet, I was delighted to discover, was free. The Health Club was absolutely awesome with a 20m indoor pool, sauna, oxygen room, gym, etc. etc. Location is a mixed bag. Its very close to the Silk Market for all your designer knockoffs and souvenirs, but other than that its in a fairly commercial part of town. Its obviously a good choice for businessmen since its attached to a convention center and there are dozens of high rise office blocks in the area. Taxis are cheap in Beijing, so location shouldn't really be a factor anyway.We didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants since the prices were absolutely horrific and there are plenty of quality restaurants nearby. Hotel staff were polite, but not particularly friendly or helpful, (appart from the guy that presses the button on the elevator). Overall this hotel has an aura of having all the elements neccessary to be a great 5 star hotel, but without any real atmosphere. For a businessman its ideal, but for a romantic getaway its a little lacking. (Perhaps if the Crowne Plaza wasn't so warm and friendly I wouldn't have felt this way.)

<Content>Completely overrated, mostly just dated Stayed here for the 3rd time in 5 years (last time was 4 years ago); definitely this hotel is showing its age and the service has deteriorated in 4 years (very sad because this was a great hotel).Stayed on the 21st floor Horizon Club level room (my favorite floor because this floor can only be accessed by stairs within the Horizon Club). Room (the most expensive non-suite, executive room) was definitely dated, dreary (replete with the wall of dark wood containing the closet/safe/etc.), uncomfortable furniture and this monstrous desk that absorbed the entire room - just not pleasing or inviting to stay in. Room key de-magnetized each day, had to wait in the long lines at reception to get a new key made (showing passport each time). Yes, the elevators require room key to access your floor so I could not go to the Horizon Club to avoid the long general reception lines but was lumped with the masses.Hotel is absolutely overbooked each and every day, loaded with foreign businessmen on expense accounts who remind the hotel that no matter how bad the service, they will keep coming back to this place because they are not adventurous enough to seek out new hotels. Horizon Club level food area (there are 2 of them) were stuffed with people each day who camp out as if they have nowhere to go -- you are waiting to eat breakfast and could wait a long time. Further, the turnover in this hotel is ridiculous, the lines at reception were crazy. Also, I had to take my own luggage (very heavy) from the taxi as there was not 1 attendant outside greeting taxis.Gym (although amply stocked with different machines) is dated and somewhat dreary (after the supposed remodeling which was done this past year).Given the increased automobile traffic in Beijing, the egress to and from the hotel by taxi is really a mess. Arriving to the hotel from the Changanjie (from say the Jianguo Hotel direction) is a complete circular traffic jam.Contacted the Director of Rooms who basically gave me the run around telling me how sorry he was, how he wanted to make me feel better about the hotel, and would get back to me ... never heard from him again. You know what? I checked out 3 nights early and went to the Hyatt - much better hotel!!!

<Content>A modern Chinese classic Anyone who does business in China today would be familiar with this hotel. Maybe I am exaggerating, but, to my mind, it is a modern take on classic hotels such as the Grand in Saigon or the Beau Rivage in Beirut. The typical China World guest likely spends most days in Beijing negotiating tough deals in either one of the neighbouring China World towers, or, if they are of a diplomatic bent, participating in the 6 party talks on North Korea. Either way, if you are staying at the China World today, you are quite likely witnessing history in some shape or another.Which to me, makes it even more remarkable that the staff at the China World never stop trying so hard. They are flawlessly polite and helpful. They could actually allow their service levels to slip one notch and still get away with it, such is the demand for accommodation at the China World due to extraneous circumstances. However, they do not rest on their laurels, and they are much the better for it.The rooms are outlandishly luxurious in a Beijing (and Shangri-la) sort of way -- you literally feel like an Empress, or an Emperor. The gym is very well equipped and does not have the perfunctory feel of other hotel gyms. The massage centre and its trained masseurs are excellent, even though overpriced in comparison with the rest of ordinary Beijing. I love this place. It is grand and over the top and does not apologise for it. I will return time and time again, almost certainly for reasons not entirely of my choosing, but I surely could not harbour any real ill will or dissatisfaction should I find myself holed up, once again, at the China World in Beijing.

<Content>Beijing's Best This is the only hotel I've stayed at in Beijing but I truly enjoy going there and don't see any reason to try others. This place continually does a great job. Example... first time I stayed there I had an early meeting so I asked if I could access the fitness center (which, by the way, is excellent and modern) an hour before it normally opens. YES - was the immediate answer. No checking with the manager or anything. When I arrived the following morning there were 2 staff and a lifeguard on hand! Rooms are spacious and well equipped, and the events in the lobby are a continual surprise between opera singers and concert pianists and violin trios it's worth it to just spend an evening in the lobby bar!

<Content>Chinaworld Beijing Just got back from there. Wow! What a find. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. THe rooms were wonderful, the health club great, excellent service, the breakfast buffet was incredible. We also stayed at the Pudong Shangri-la. Prices on food, business services, laundry, and massages all cheaper at Chinaworld and it is a slightly nicer hotel.

<Content>Wonderful service with a smile Recently traveled to China for the first time. First stop was Beijing and the China World Hotel (part of the Shangra-la group). This is a wonderful business hotel. All the support services you could ask for and more. The staff was happy to help with any request. Ate in three of the hotels restaurants and they were very good. Also upgraded to the executive level which was worth the extra cost as it included a full breakfast; afternoon snacks enough for a light dinner; free laundry; and a nice lounge for meetings. Happy to recommend this property to those visiting Beijing.

<Content>Wow...what an experience. I've stayed in hotels in many cities throughout the world, but never before have I been entertained by a full orchestra and five excellent opera singers in the lobby bar! After a long walk one Sunday, we returned to the China World and enjoyed this spectical. The rooms were very modern, decorated with flair and totally comfortable. I guess I expected to rough it in China---how wrong I was! Stay at the China World for a fabulous experience. Another plus is that the hotel is two blocks from Silk Alley! Fabulous shopping!

<Content>One of the best hotels I have stayed in My husband and I stayed here for a weeks holiday. Very luxurious and comfortable. Food excellent, staff very friendly and helpful. We were however surprised at how expensive the bars and restaurants were considering the cost of living in China. Taxis needed for sight seeing and shopping unless your budget runs to the designer mall underneath the hotel!!

<Content>Surprisingly good. 3 nights here on business, on my first trip to China. Lobby beautiful. Room a bit small but well appointed, bed and pillows/linen very comfortable, bathroom excellent. Staff very friendly and efficient, despite English not being spoken a great deal on the front desk. Still - international sign languages seemed to work OK. Food was a tad on the wobbly side - especially room service, but never a disaster, maye just the issue of western food in China. Health Club and Gym were outstanding. Three indoor tennis courts in the hotel as well.

<Content>Nice Hotel The China World has a beautiful lobby upon entry. And the rooms are nice but not special. Ours was a nonsmoking but it smelled of smoke. We found one person, Vivian, behind the front desk that spoke good english but it was difficult to communicate with others at the entry. The all day restaurant had a buffet but you could also order off the menu. It was expensive for China, which is usually a bit cheaper than most countries. Also, the location was near the American Embassy and about a 15 minute walk to the new Silk Street shopping building. It is quite a long way to get to the Forbidden City, a definite cab ride. So depending on whether shopping is what you want or history, you might chose China World or the Hyatt, which is much closer to the history.

<Content>Not so much for the money OK, it's a nice hotel. It has a nice exercise facility. It has internet that actually lets you do business (with a VPN), which I understand is rare in China. But the rooms are... merely adequate, and everything is outrageously expensive.Buffet breakfast for three? 50 dollars.Want a coke? 3 dollars.Airport pickup? 50 dollars. (Cab costs 15, found out later.)Ouch.Recommended for those on expense account.

<Content>I Am Impressed I am a Malaysian born 3rd generation chinese and educated in the UK.Never gave a second thought of going China because of the old ideology.I have made peace with the homeland of my ancestors and I am proud to be chinese with a 5,000year culture.Thanks to the late President Richard Nixon for opening the doors to China.The hotel my wife and I stayed in is excellent. The food and service is 5 Star. The only problem is the Greeter can only say good morning only further conversation draws a blank face. Staff at the reception hardly speaks English. Wake up, the Olympics is less than 1000 days away.Transport is chaotic and as the saying goes it is an economic indicator of prosperity. If you take the subway it is clean,safe and pleasant.China is ready to take on the world.My only son is now in Shanghai and will be in Beijing this weekend.We will be there again

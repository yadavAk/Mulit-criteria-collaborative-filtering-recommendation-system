<Content>Nice, but with problems... We spent 6 nights at this hotel, and were not too impressed with it. First of all, we were given two twin beds, and the staff was unable to find a king/queen bed room for us, even though we stayed for a 6 nights, which is a pretty long stay. They had rooms available with a queen bed, but at a higher rate, and were unwilling to give us (since we were unwilling to pay extra!). Second, unless you're into the Olympic village, which is right next to the hotel, the location is not convenient, the hotel is pretty far out, there's not much around it, and you need to take a taxi or the subway (which is 15 minutes away) to go to the attractions. Third, I needed to get train tickets to go to Shanghai, and most hotels can buy tickets for you for a small fee, well, this upscale, expensive hotel, has a travel center that would arrange only airplane tickets (at a crazy price) with a staffer who didn't speak English, no train tickets. So they ended up sending me to the post office to get my train tickets which was complicated given that I don't speak Chinese. Considering that the post office is close to the hotel, and that they have plenty of staff, and that all hotels provide train tickets, it's appalling that this pretentious hotel wouldn't help guests with such a common request, simply ridiculous! Fourth, the rate was way too high for what we got: 1,800RMB/night with only one breakfast. Given the location, and service provided. Fifth, there were some problems with the rate they initially quoted us, and with a breakfast we were overcharged for, and when we were checking out it took one hour to solve these simple issues. The nice things about this hotel are the clean, comfortable rooms, some staff speaks pretty good English, and most of all a very nice (albeit expensive, 170rmb per person!) breakfast. But overall, I wouldn't recommend it for tourists, too far out, too expensive for what you get, no help for train tickets.

<Content>Great Hotel till........ I have been a regular for Crowne Plaza Wuzhou for the last 2 years. It has offered great service and facility for bussiness. Till I encounter the incident below.My recent stay from Sep 5th to Sep 10th has been tainted by a staff at the breakfast cafe. The staff that was preparing the omellete/chinese pancake was rather rude to be in a five star hotel like Crowne Plaza. I ordered my chinese pancake for 30 minutes it was not served, and during the interval 3 reminders was given to him. The staff did not even offered an appology. Hope the hotel management can look into the black horse that tainted a great hotel

<Content>Nice hotel, great gym. I stayed at this hotel for a recent meeting, which was held in the hotel itself. It's an excellent facility, and I highly recommend it. The rooms are nice, as you'd expect at this price point. The breakfast buffet is ample, and covers about five different cuisines! The hotel gym/pool is great. As a swimmer, I was impressed that the pool was long enough (probably about 50 feet) to do laps, and square enough to do flip turns on both ends.The hotel is on the 4th ring road, very close to the olympic venues. If you want to get into Beijing center (eg forbidden city) it's about a 30 yuan cab ride that took us 20-45 minutes depending on traffic.If you do not speak Mandarin, I'd recommend that you get the chinese characters for the hotel name/address printed out on paper before you arrive at the airport. Not all the taxi drivers at the airport could read the English name/address that I had printed out from the hotel website.All in all though, this is a great choice, particularly if you need to be north of Beijing during your trip.

<Content>Two Weeks...was pretty nice I had a business trip to the Technology Park (Motorola, Nortel, Ericsson) and had a two week stay at the Crown. Overall, I would have to say the experience was excellent. The staff was excellent. The breakfast buffet was amazing and the location was decent for a stay to Beijing. Tourism wise, most of your destinations that are outside of Beijing are towards the North. Its a bit of a walk to the subway (prob a mile) but there are plenty of Taxis available too. They have a shuttle for folks heading out to the tech park though too. Thats a nice touch! Kudos for that.Its next to the Olympic park so thats pretty neat. Laundry is REALLY expensive so pack accordingly. There are plenty of places to eat close to the hotel too.Drinks are expensive....but here is a little hint. Right next to the elevators is a staff only entrance. There is a Coke machine thats super cheap right by the door. Shhh.Overall, it was an excellent experience. Then again, Im easy to please and it was on the company dime.

<Content>TIred Stayed for 2 nights at the club level of Crowne Plaza Wuzhou. The hotel is adjacent to the BICC, which was the main purpose of our visit to Beijing. Hotel looked impressive from the outside. Staff generally courteous, helpful and many can speak English. Lobby alright except for the smell of cigarette smoke. Only 3 lifts available during our visit as the other 3 were undergoing renovation. Club lounge does not serve food or snacks, only has limited variety of drinks available. Room was spacious. However thermostat was not working well. Even though it was cold outside (7C), the room was stuffy without much ventilation so we ended up having to open the windows to let the cool breeze in. Room safe available, bath amenities provided, apples available in the room and in hallway. Generally not raving about the hotel. Would be better to stay in another hotel for the price we paid. Major construction undergoing on adjacent lot, so expect noise at night, which we heard despite staying on the 15th floor (hotel max 17 levels).

<Content>Great Location The Crowne Plaza is right opposite the Olympic Stadium in Wuzhou. The hotel is very clean, modern and comfortable. The staff are as helpful as possible but there are quite often language barrier problems. The hotel has several restuarants all reasonably priced and very nice. Hotel staff assisted with bookings to visit Great Wall, Tianamen Square, Forbidden City etc either via taxi or with tour guide. There are several good restuarants, supermarket and shopping area about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. The pool and gym area also very good.

<Content>Pleasantly surprised I went to Beijing for a conference and this hotel was right next to the BICC. It's in the Olympic village area, but not suitable for people doing business downtown. I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the hotel - spotless, young, polite staff with a lot of initiative, excellent restaurant etc. My 'Deluxe' room was huge with the bathroom bigger than a hotel room in Tokyo. Everything worked and I was impressed by how clean it was. Being a Chinese national, I must say I am proud of the amazing progress of my country and its people. Bravo, Beijing, I hope you won't let us down in 2008!

<Content>Great hotel for Olympics The Crown Plaza Wuzhou is an excellent 5star hotel. Clean, spacious well appointed rooms with helpful English speaking staff. The breakfast buffet had everything you could wish for, both western and chinese, including freshly squeezed fruit and vegetable juices made to order, which made a great start to the morning. The Brazilian restaurant was excellent and made a welcome change to chinese food.We stayed here while attending a conference as it is adjacent to the Conference Centre, but it is about a 45minute taxi ride to the center of Beijing. However it is across the road from the Olympic stadium and with the opening of the new metro lines next year it will be a perfect place to stay.

<Content>Perfect hotel for short trip This hotel was really a star in comparing to other nearing hotels. It is 5-star hotel and have really good service and rooms. Rooms are quite not fully luxurious, but above the average. Rooms were always clean, good smells, beds comfortable, and everything worked. The room was on the small side but perfectly adequate for three (two adults and one child). Breakfast was really excellent - with foods from almost every continents. The hotel's location is its main drawback, being some 30 til 45 minutes of driving with taxi from the center, where are all touristic locations are. This will change next year (in 2008) after they will finish subway (metro), which will be located right on the corner of the hotel. In that case this hotel will be best bed for families. Only weather and air pollution is in July in Beijing really bad. Tourist should go to Beijing only in October or at the beginning of November and avoid comming in summer months.I will always recommend the hotel to all.

<Content>Enjoyed our stay We stayed at this hotel in January 2007. My husband was in Beijing on business travel and stayed here for three weeks. We found the hotel to be very nice, clean, and the service to be excellent during our stay. Please be aware that this hotel is not located in downtown Beijing where all the tourist sites are, so be prepared to take a taxi if you stay here. You won't be able to walk to the sites from the hotel. However, taxis are constantly dropping off people at the hotel, so getting a taxi to take you downtown is not a problem and the price is not expensive. One thing I'd like to mention is that this hotel is within walking distance of the Olympic Stadium for the 2008 Summer Olympics and appears to be very close to where all the olympic activities in Beijing will be held. If you are planning to visit for the Olympics, I believe this hotel will be in very close proximity to the events. We definitely enjoyed our stay here. It seemed to be a favorite amongst business travelers. The hotel restaurants and room service were very good. The breakfast buffet catered to everyone with international cuisines from american, european, and asian. The pool and gym facilities were very nice too. We would definitely stay here again if we had to return to Beijing.

<Content>Excellent Dining Experience Stayed in this hotel for 5 nights. The rooms very frankly tired and in need of refurbishment, however very clean. Beds were firm and very comfortable. Options are for a king bed or 2 large king singles and as we were there with our 6 year old child a roll in bed was offered and worked well. I would consider the rooms overheated but we were able to get the window opened for fresh air. Without doubt dining at cafe Asia was outstanding and run by an Australian Executive chef catering to all tastes. The cost was very reasonable (148 rmb for dinner buffet) per person and the child free. We ate all our meals in Cafe Asia as it was so diverse, exciting and fresh that you could not do better outside. I would definately stay here again as what the rooms lacked in glamour was more than compensated by the dining experience.

<Content>A real five star Hotel I stayed there for about one week at the end of June for the attendance of a conference. This is probably the best five star hotel I have ever been.Staff were most polite and helpful (as one would expect from Chinese culture?). Just an example, I asked for a plug adaptor from Chinese to European. They came immediatly bringing a variety (!!!) of equipment for every posible scenario. Room service was also very fast and good. The room was very large and clean, and contained everything one can possibly need. Breakfast also included everything a reasonable person can ask for. There are three restaurants in the hotel (at least, I found three). I used only the one next to the Palm lobby(?). They have an excellent buffet for dinner which includes great variety and very good quality in both wester and easter cuisine. Staff in the restaurant are also very polite and efficient (some times their English is not very good, but we have to be understanding). The two other restaurants have cantonese (that is of southern China) and meat dishes, but I did not try them as the buffet completely covered me and my friends. The area in which the hotel is located is rather rich and upcoming and there are shops and a large supermarket less than 10' walk from the hotel. The olympic stadium that will host the 2008 Olympic games is very near the hotel. The hotel is between 20 and 40 minutes (depending on the time of the day) from Tiananmen square. Given how cheap taxis are in China, it is in a very good location.

<Content>Problems with the staff Stayed at this hotel using rewards nights with hotels priority club points and hotel voucher from travel agent. Staff on VIP floor had difficulties comprehending simple questions in english. Had to deal with assistant managers in order to get reservations clarified. Stayed there for eleven nights and staff did not resolve hotel voucher reservation problem until the day of check out. Had to spend several hours of my time requesting the staff to clarify the problem. Same problem and attitude dealing with staff at front desk in the Lobby level. Had difficulty exchanging traveller's cheques or Canadian/american currency at the front desk. Ended up having to walk to nearby bank to exchange travellers cheques. Better to just take out amount needed from ATM machine in the lobby.The hotel was very comfortable otherwise. The rest of the staff in the restaurant, fitness room, pool, housekeeping, concierge provided excellent service. Hotel and rooms very clean. Carpets in the rooms and hallways could use a washing. Approximately 30 minutes outside of downtown core. Cost 35 to 40 RMB to travel by taxi to most places. Book the Club rooms. Rate includes breakfast upstairs in the Club Lounge or downstairs restaurant. Club rate also includes cocktails in the afternoon and use of internet services.

<Content>Perfect if you have business around there (Sorry about my english) Due to bookingerror at the CP Qingdao I spent 1 night an the CP Park view. I can say that you are treated like a VIP in this hotel. Big (club) room, perfect breakfast, very nice personel. My internet problems were solved within a moment. Location is very outside the center of Beijing therefore i changed to the CP in the center with no problems. Club manager was perfect!!! I can recommend it for business!

<Content>great hotel for business travellers and couples I travel to Beijing often and have stayed at several hotels over the years, but this one is great! Attentive service, clean, comfortable rooms, friendly staff and a good set of restaurants. lots of really good restaurants close by as well for more local flavor (especially hot pots and peking duck). Concierge is very knowledgeable and helpful. terrific beds and pillows and great bath robes. good value for my money

<Content>great brazilian restaurant! In November I had to spend a couple of weeks on a business trip in Asia. I also went to Beijing. My company booked me into the Crowne Plaza Park View. Altogether I had a really good stay-experience. The hotel is pretty new and the facilities are what you would expect from a five star hotel. A couple of asian restaurant, big pool, etc. What I liked best about the hotel was its brazilian restaurant though. I was longing for some meat after all this asian food and that is what I got. The waiter comes to your table and slices down as much meat, sausage, etc. as you want. I thought it was a pretty cheap all you can eat deal as well. Recommended if you are into meat!

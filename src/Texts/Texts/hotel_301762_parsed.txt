<Content>GWS...look elsewhere Probably the worst experience as a Platinum Starwoods member. I was taken aback by the horrendous d茅cor but that was just an ominous sign of things to come. The d茅cor is ancient and would be appropriate in a 2 or 3 star hotel. The front desk staff and front office manager 鈥?Cynthia Wang 鈥?have a lot to learn about customer service. Given the attitude of Ms.Wang 鈥?it is obvious where the staff take their cue.The front desk staff find it too difficult to treat their paying guests with a bit of courtesy. They are more concerned with following rules rather than making their paying guests feel welcome! For example, when we arrived 鈥?tired from our flights and looking forward to just getting settled into a room, the response from the person who was checking us in was to quote me rules and regulations. It was more important for him to say 鈥淥ur policy is 鈥?鈥????!!!. These staff have not heard 鈥渇irst impressions are lasting impressions鈥?and if they find helping the paying guests with a little bit of courtesy too much to do, then they are in the wrong business. We gave up trying to check in and moved to another hotel 鈥?one which really appreciated our business.With the choice of hotels available in Beijing, I won鈥檛 be back. This hotel deserves to be shunned.

<Content>A Very Nice Hotel I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. It was one of the first joint western joint venture hotels in Beijing but it has been completely refurbished. Everything sparkles: service, food, hallways, and the rooms. our room was large and comfortable and very clean. It was amply stocked with water, tea and coffee. My only complaint is that the frint desk was ridiculously picky about exchanging US $20 bills. The clerk rejected half of my bills for one reason or another: one had a pen mark, one had too many creases, one had a corner fold, one had a small tear, and two were not the new $20 bills. Other than that we really enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.

<Content>Really nice hotel--Great Wall Sheraton We stayed 1 week at the Sheraton Great Wall. The hotel manager was very helpful as well as the concierge. We booked the hotel once we arrived in Beijing and negotiated a much reduced rate. I found the location to be excellent and enjoyed half hour to an hour walk around the consulates.Great to see the Olympic venues after the Olympics. Hotel can book tour of the big O venues.

<Content>Reasonably priced hotel We stayed as a small group at the The Great Wall Sheraton Hotel, Beijing for a few days in January 2007.The hotel is well located and the main attractions are only a short taxi ride away. The hotel was a reasonable price but I felt that the buffet was a little expensive but good. There are a few better chinese restaurants round the corner.The rooms were clean and adequate

<Content>Not so bad Having stayed here for over a month while working at the Olympics, I'll have to say that the place isn't as bad as some of the reviews offer (but everybody has a right to their opinion!). Beds are western style beds (many hotels have hard Chinese beds) so this is a real plus! The lounge music is truly awful and travels throughoutthe lower floors of the hotel. This is truly the worst experience of the hotel.Ask for a corner room at the far ends of the halls. You get double windows, instead of the standard single window, so the rooms are much lighter. The housekeeping, wait staff, etc, are very sweet. The front desk staff are a nightmare and it takes forever to process a single request. For example, I was going from a company paid stay to a pre-paid, personal stay and it took 40 minutes for 3 people at the front desk to process. And they still wanted me to change rooms because they said someone was in the room....that would be me! The hotel is very convenient now that the subway is open just a few blocks away. There are some excellent local Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, as well as some decent Italian restaurants if you are craving a pizza!. The hotel will be closing later this year or early next year for a much needed make over per hotel management. One of my collegues stayed here 25 years ago when it first opened and the makeover is long overdue.All in all, if you choose the Sheraton, it's not bad at all and I easily managed 40 plus days there.

<Content>Old habits die hard This is the third year in succession that I've stayed at the GWS. Some of the other reviews I find puzzling as I have to say the service and accommodation are very good indeed. The food in the various restaurants could be best described as adequate rather than exciting but for the business traveller the hotel represents good value (excellent in-room IT) and is convenient for the airport. The small shopping area also sells things you'd probably want to buy and at least there's a proper bar area. The architecture is correctly described in some of the other reviews though. It is quite simply awful with all the charm of a Swindon call centre. Perhaps best not to look to hard!One black mark is that on a previous visit a colleague had asked me to get a copy of a bill from a previous stay as he'd had no luck in trying to obtain this by correspondence. Front desk management seemed to understand what I was requesting but nothing was ever done despite various promises.

<Content>good hotel, bring your own laptop Having stayed at this property previously (and liked it), I decided to base myself here again during the Olympics. I was able to use my Starwood frequent stay points for an executive floor room.As the first luxury hotel in Beijing, the exterior architecture is dated (and ugly), but the interior is still well cared for and generally up-to-date. Service remains good, but the concierges seemed less knowledgable than before. The breakfast buffet (the one in the Italian-themed restaurant is best) is excellent. There is also a good assortment of food and beverage in the executive lounge in the evenings.A new subway line has opened up 2 blocks from the hotel at the Lufthansa Center. This is a welcome development because traffic in Beijing is generally horrible (except on Sundays) and the subway presents a reasonable alternative to certain destinations.The hotel is very convenient to the airport with a taxi ride costing about US $10.The immediate surroundings of the hotel are not particularly interesting, but the location on the third ring is good for travelling throughout the city.One minor irritant is the charge for internet access if you do not bring a laptop. Even on the executive floor, it was 25 US cents per minute. A typical Beijing internet cafe charges about US $1.30 an hour (too bad there are none near the hotel I could find). Many hotels offer free internet.

<Content>Worst Starwood experience It is the worst Starwood hotel that i have ever stayed from a customer service perspective. I have bad experiences with almost all the staff, from the bell boy to the SPG manager, Belinda Gu, to the restaurant staff, housekeeping staff and security staff. All displayed consistent poor service attitude like rude, indifferent, welcoming us to lodge complaints, unprofessional, etc..

<Content>Enjoyed the Great Wall Sheraton Very nice hotel. Rooms are very spacious, beds are confortable and amenities are good. Views from the rooms, though not astonishing, were OK.Breakfast is great: bufet with good selection of occidental and chinese dishes.Staff is friendly in general and helpful.Although not centric, there is a nice shopping mall 1 block apart and a beautiful park 15 minutes walking distance (Sun Park).There are also some shops in the hotel.We didn't try the restaurants, but there were 3, and also some inexpensive ones near the hotel.The pool and health club are OK.Beijing's traffic is chaotic everywhere, so be prepared to spend quite a lot of time waiting in jams to get to Tiananmen Square.

<Content>Truly Awful Place This hotel doesnt deserve the star rating it holds. Its dated and tired looking. The staff were inexperienced and often unable to understand very simple requests. The place just needs to be revamped and staff retrained. I moved to the Ritz Carton on a better daily rate and received real five star treatment!

<Content>Enjoyed the Sheraton Beijing After traveling around China our last 5 days at the Great Wall Sheraton were an extremely enjoyable experience. Although not modern, the rooms and facilities are very comfortable while the service we received was first class. The pool facilities were terrific and the location very convenient especially getting there from the airport. On our last evening we decided to have dinner at the French Tavern in the hotel. The degustation menu was outstanding, the price reasonable and the english-speaking staff very accomplished. We are a couple in our early sixties and can recommend this hotel four our age group.

<Content>Overpriced, with incessant lounge music Although service at this hotel is generally good, I have a major complaint: Extremely loud, extremely annoying live music from a trio of lounge singers six nights a week in the atrium lobby reaches most guest rooms on the first five floors. This act performs until nearly 10:45 pm EVERY NIGHT except Sunday. Got an early-morning business appointment? Don't count on getting to bed before 11 pm unless hearing loud Abba songs over and over again lulls you to sleep. There is no excuse for this intolerable noise at a quality hotel. My other beef is the overpriced food at the Italian trattoria by the lounge. This is where most guests have breakfast and sometimes dine. Compared to Beijing restaurants, it's very expensive, but the quantity and quality don't make up for the price tag. Potential guests should also consider that this hotel is quite a distance from sights like the Forbidden City, but for the Olympics venues it isn't too bad. The closest subway station is a five-minute taxi ride away, though a closer one is being built.

<Content>Still Not Up to Par The Great Wall Sheraton markets itself as Beijing's oldest 5 star international hotel. I have always wondered why a hotel company, especially one in China, where buildings age as quickly as dogs, would include that information in their marketing materials. Maybe it is to prepare guests for the not so up to date facilities and services they will receive at the hotel.Check In and Check Out and Lobby: I heard that the Sheraton had been renovated recently, so I was disappointed when I walked in the lobby to find that it had not changed much at all from my last visit 4 years ago. Fading metallic gold columns and dim lighting define this lobby, while the rather plentiful sofas in the area are always full of members of tour groups and business conventions. The lobby's most exciting feature, the bakery, is a breath of delight with some gorgeous chocolate creations on prominent display. Closer inspection reveals that the prices on these treats are higher than most other hotels in Beijing, including the nearby Kempinski Hotel with its well renowned sweets department. Bursting my bubbles even further, the staff member behind the pastry counter let me in on a secret - that the pastries are all made by a supplier off site and shipped to the hotel in the morning. As for check in, I went to the front desk to start the process, but they asked me to go to the club lounge instead since only they would be able to assist with a club floor check in. I put my documents in my pocket and rode the lift to the 13th floor club lounge, where there was one tiny check in table and a line of hurried executives waiting anxiously to check out and be on their way. My turn came, and the receptionist, noting the rather unusual check in time of 8am, did a quick search, found a room that was clean and ready, and after the usual paperwork, handed me the keys. She also passed me a breakfast coupon, explaining that I was authorized breakfast only at the club floor lounge and that I would need to exchange the coupon for it. I asked if I could use it right then and there, as I was hungry, and she replied it would only be good on the following day and that I would need to pay an additional fee if I wanted breakfast today. That special restriction felt a bit odd and even old fashioned, as most club lounges I have visited are rather flexible about when and how a breakfast is enjoyed.I was back in 10 minutes, reporting a very smoky room and requesting a smoke free one. The receptionist was gracious, though her smile was strained, and after a further search, found a room for me that did work and was smoke free.Rooms: I was checked into a junior suite, a rather small room (textbook Hong Kong!) with a very long hallway that seemed to waste most of the place's space. The bathroom was small but comfortable, though it was surprising to see a combined bath and shower, rather than the separate bath and shower guests experience at most newly renovated luxury hotels in China these days. I imagine that when this hotel was designed 19 years ago, this kind of bathroom was typical of the times, and that recent refurbishments were not able to overcome that dated design. As for the other parts of the room, the bed was very comfortable, the Bose CD player was a great amenity, but nothing else was very remarkable.Service: Beijing hotels are all struggling at this time to retain staff as a host of new hotel and restaurant openings are tempting many of the more seasoned employees to jump ship for better positions and pay. This challenge seems like it has been a headache for the Sheraton. Two of the three hosts in the club lounge barely spoke or understood English, and the one who was conversant in the language was so busy with customers that she appeared to have little time to breathe. I spoke Chinese with them to help make things easier, but the first two were so new to the hotel that they couldn't answer any of my questions and referred me to the 3rd who was already overworked. Security and concierge staff had smiles that were quick to appear and disappear, and the front desk staff on the first floor were always busy.Food: Restaurants were typical hotel restaurants with normal food. Breakfast at the club lounge was small and mediocre, and included some surprises like chocolate mousse cake and sushi (looked as if they were left over from last night's buffet). Location: One of the hotel's strengths is its location. Close to the airport, yet in the heart of the city's popular Chao Yang District, from the Sheraton many of the city's attractions are a short drive away. Hard Rock Cafe is just around the corner (currently being remodelled), the embassy district is across the street, and popular bar and restaurant district Sanlitun is a 10 to 15 minute taxi ride away. For those who enjoy public transportation, the nearest subway line is a 20 minute taxi ride away, while a newer line will open in a month or two just steps from the hotel. That opening will be a big plus when considering Beijing's infamous traffic.Facilities: The health club - especially pool and changing rooms - feels rather old and in need of updating. The pool is small and a bit dank.With a new Westin hotel opening across the street in July, as well as the lovely Kempinski hotel and a newly refurbished Hilton just around the corner, this Sheraton has a bit of catching up to do if it is going to stay competitive. As Beijing and its top international hotels are all gearing up for the Olympics, it seems that the Sheraton has fallen behind, and is clinging too tightly to its proud 19 year history. For those who plan to stay in the area, I advise not staying at the Sheraton.

<Content>Not Starwwod Preferred I recently stayed at the GWSH, after the hotel was booked by a tour organiser. Position was good, rooms ok, aircon didn't work, food ok, but biggest problem was the front desk. Essentially they ignored my Starwood Preferred Guest card and advised me that it didn't apply because the booking was made through an agent. I was only able to utilise the late checkout by simply staying until 4pm then on checkout pointing out my entitlement. After indicating to the gentlement on reception that his comments were obviously incorrect and pointing out all the breakfast charges were also incorrect (as our accom voucher clearly included full breakfasts) there was a shrug of the shoulders and an ok. I have a lot of experience with hotel management ageements and suspect Sheraton are not really managing this property and I can only presume they are on some licence fee in return for use of the name. Very dangerous thing to do with a brand !!!!!

<Content>bad decision, bad hotel I booked this room for a guy from my company, assuming that it would be good because of the Sheraton name. He was not at all happy with the hotel, old and dirty was his description. After one night we managed to move him just across the street to the landmark hotel, which was half the price and much nicer (100usd). I really don't understand what Sheraton is thinking, maybe they get enough money from tourist groups and don't care about individual guests.

<Content>Two star service for five star prices. I cannot understand how Sheraton can allows its name to be used on this run-down, poorly-serviced property. My company booked me there for three days, assuring me that I was staying at a five star property. But from the moment I saw the garish silver and red exterior, I felt that something was off about this property. Inside, it was even worse - the lobby is dark and grimy. Bell hops refused to carry bags, and the check-in is unbearably long.But it gets worse.Like other recent tripadvisor reviewers, I am an SPG Starwood Gold member - but the front desk reviewed to upgrade me per the SPG agreement. They even told me that they don't participate in that part of the program. So much for Sheraton standards!On the way to my room (carrying my own bags) I was appalled by the condition of this hotel. The carpets are dirty and mussed and pulling away from the walls. My room had water stains on the walls and the bathroom furnishings were ancient. When I complained, the front desk was incredibly rude.Beijing is now bursting with new, quality hotels in advance of the Olympics. There are many, many better options than this one. And those options are clean, up-to-date, and the staff does not treat customers with contempt.I'd hate to be around when the hotel's Olympic visitors arrive and find out what they're getting for elevated five star prices.If you don't believe me, read the other reviews here. I wish that somebody at my office had read them before booking me in this awful property.Better two-star hotels exist in Beijing for less than half the price. Sheraton needs to clean out this facility - and all of the current management. I won't stay there again - and I recommend that others avoid it at all costs.

<Content>Best Hotel in China!! This is by far the best hotel I ever stayed in China so far. The staff are friendly  very efficient. Check in was FAST!! I got a non-smoking king-bed room as requested. The room is not fantastic, but very comfortable. The smiles  friendliness of the Housekeeping staff made me feel like home. Inroom dining was also great, and certainly fast!! Best pasta I ever had in Beijing. I like the live band at their lounge, so relaxing after a day's work....

<Content>Sheraton is old and tired How in the world did the Sheraton get a 5-star rating? My husband  I stayed there for 3 nights the 1st week of April. We flew in from Shanghai where we stayed at the Four Seasons. Upon arriving at the Sheraton, we can immediately tell the difference between these 2 hotels. The Sheraton lobby looks tired and old. It took a while for us to check in (the receptionist claimed that the system wasn't working right.) When we arrived at our floor, we noticed the hallway carpet was full of water stains and buckling all over the place; wallpaper was peeling off the wall. Just plain old yucky.Our room was standard in size with a king size bed. But the TV and air conditioning didn't work. We called housekeeping, help arrived quickly. She immediatly knew that the TV was disconnected, but she told us she couldn't fix the AC problem because the system wasn't turned on yet. She suggested us to open the window to rid the stuffiness. But if you've stayed in China before, you'd know that sleeping with the window open is not a wise thing - it's noisy and the air is polluted.Services at the hotel is minimum at best. So don't expect anyone to go out of their way to help you. Our concerige was a trainee, though she was earnest in trying to help us, she didn't seem to know much about her city.We read in some local news that Beijing is expected to have 354 new hotels by the end of 2008. There sure are a lot more choices to pick than choosing the Sheraton. It needs a good facelift before it can compete with these expected newcomers.

<Content>My worst hotel experience (of more than 600) The worst hotel service I have ever received was at the Sheraton Great Wall Beijing. Of 100 Sheraton鈥檚, 250+ Starwood stays and more than 600 hotel stays this is the one hotel that I left tired, hungry and upset, on a rate that included breakfast. My father was a guest of the Chinese government to receive a lifetime research honor. My mother and I joined him, and rather than crowd into the guest house with him, I was loyal to Starwood. That was a big mistake. Despite remarkable treatment at the The Hotel Imperial, The Le Meridien Budapest, The Hotel Maria Cristina and the Sheraton Saporro on previous trips, my parents now want to double check the hotel I suggest after the singularly bad experience at the Sheraton Great Wall in Beijing. Here are the things I wrote down upon departure from the hotel: Check in took more than an hour-and-a-half. I went to the front desk, was sent to the 13th floor, was sent back鈥?and forth 3 times. At first my platinum status was not recognized, then it was, but I was told Starwood platinums do not get upgrades, then I was given an upgrade but it was a smoking room. I finally ended up in a Jr. Suite on a floor with teenagers partying all night. Doors were slamming, music was blaring, I was 15 years older than everyone else on the floor. My Mom was so furious at having to wait more than an hour to check in, that we kept the room and she passed out. My father and I were going to grab a drink before he returned to his hotel. We asked how long the bar was open, and we were told until the end of the hour. We agreed we鈥檇 handle the luggage (nice work by the bellman to stare at all the girls dressed up for their formal and ignore the hotel guests) and we鈥檇 make sure Mom was settled in. Dad and I returned to the bar half an hour before the time they were supposed to close and found that this was the night they were closing early to shampoo the rugs. When I asked the front desk agent if there was another place to get a drink, she said, not tonight, the bar is closing early for cleaning. I told her she was the one that told me it was open until the end of the hour, and she told me she assumed I meant each night. I have no idea why she wouldn鈥檛 think a guest checking in would want to know what time the bar closed on the same night they arrived鈥?She suggested I go to the 13th floor lounge, where I鈥檇 already been turned away at check in, so Dad, now irate, and I went to try again. After already completing 32 stays that year, I was told that I didn鈥檛 have access to the executive/platinum lounge. Tony (don鈥檛 know his last name) in the lounge told me it was only for Starwood鈥檚 most elite members and I should aspire to Platinum. His words: Maybe you will achieve Platinum status for next year. I told him I had already re-earned it for this year and he asked me for my card, which I hadn鈥檛 received from Starwood, so he told me without a card, I had no access to the lounge. Suddenly, a platinum that I鈥檇 met at the Sheraton Palo Alto 3 years before vouched for me and dad and we entered as his guest! He told me he鈥檇 had trouble with their service as well and we enjoyed the complimentary coffee and tea. The next day started just as poorly, since the requested wake-up call never came. We were woken by the noisy teenagers who had been there for their formal the night before. I found it odd that other guests had a newspaper hanging on their door. We did not. My Mom and I went to the lounge, but were turned away because they didn鈥檛 recognize me as an SPG platinum. My Mom and I went down to the restaurant, asked where we got the breakfast included in the room rate, were sent to the front desk, who told me that our weekend bed and breakfast rate did not include breakfast! After 30 minutes, I forced my way into the platinum lounge, put food in a paper bag and walked out to begin our day. Mom was embarrassed and I was disgraced. I鈥檝e become so used to good Starwood service and this was disheartening. When we returned, we tried to enter the lounge again, this time I just sucked it up and paid for access to the platinum lounge, which I should have had for free. Trying to learn more about breakfast, I spoke with Rosa Liu and Tony Zhou, who told me they did not show breakfast included in my rate, even though it was a 鈥淲eekend bed  breakfast rate.鈥?They did tell me: 鈥淵ou are at a special rate of 1350 Yuan, which is less than 1700 Yuan and you should not expect to have any platinum benefits... you were upgraded to a Jr. Suite and we did not have to do that.鈥?I guess that鈥檚 why it took me more than hour to check in. They made a big point of the fact that lounge access was a privilege, not a right because I was not paying a business rate. I asked the hotel to mail the Sheraton post cards that they provided me. I was told this hotel does not participate. I would later see a different lounge attendant offer postcards to a different guest, and tell them they鈥檇 mail them anywhere in the world for that guest. I guess they were paying a business rate.I asked the concierge at the front of the hotel for travel time to the Peking Acrobat performance that we were attending that night. The theatre is less than 4 km from the Sheraton Great Wall and we鈥檇 seen it during our sight-seeing, but I wanted to be sure. The concierge told me it would take 1.5 hours by taxi. I inquired why, and they said there may be traffic and they weren鈥檛 sure how you would get to the theatre. The theatre is visible from the same ring road as the Sheraton Great Wall, so I adjusted the time to 45 minutes, and we still arrived 20 minutes early. That was not a reliable concierge. Late that night, upon returning from the show, a lounge attendant told me they鈥檇 identified I was a platinum and let me in to the lounge, which was now only serving coffee and milk. I asked them to set a wake-up call. They told me it was a 鈥淥ne time exception for 0730 wake up call.鈥?I asked for delivery of coffee with the wake-up call at 0730, which the property advertises is standard for elite level guests. Again, I was told that even though my platinum status had finally been confirmed, I was not an elite level guest because I was on the eighth floor. The wake up call came from the tour desk at 0715, saying something in Chinese. After a few minutes, I was told my tour bus is departing the hotel and I am the last person to get aboard. Not true since I was not going on a tour, I had a 1 PM airplane for Chicago. The real wake-up call, coffee and newspaper arrive at 0750, 20 minutes late. By then my Mom and I have begun to expect this from this property and by now, the rest should be smooth sailing. All we have to do is eat breakfast, meet up with my father and check out. What could go wrong? We head down an hour before our scheduled meeting with my father, ask for breakfast in Trattoria, where the manager last night told us to go. We are told our rate does not include breakfast and Mom is sent to the executive lounge, where she charms her way in. After 40 minutes, the day manager confirms that my rate does include breakfast. By then I had 5 minutes to eat, but dad showed up early, so no breakfast again... When Dad  I returned, I spoke to Paul Yi, a manager about this horrible stay, he told me he will e~mail me with some sort of resolution. I never heard from him again. Mom sagely told me to give extra time to check out. The line is full at the front desk, so I go upstairs to the lounge, which knows me well by now and I鈥檝e been told can check me out. Check out there takes 30 minutes. Mom is close to a heart attack, because she likes to be at the airport 3 hours before. We though checkout would take a maximum of 15 minutes. To add insult to injury while I鈥檓 waiting to check out in the 13th floor lounge, an attendant tells another guest that they should invite their friends who are staying a different hotel. So I can hardly get in the lounge, I have to sneak my mother in, am charged for access, can鈥檛 bring my father, but other people can bring guests, just as the platinum I knew from a previous trip did with me. That is a glaring inconsistency鈥?but as I was told, I鈥檓 not entitled to full platinum 鈥淧riveleges鈥?because I鈥檓 not paying a business rate. As soon as I disembarked the plane, I called Starwood for a copy of the reservation. It states clearly that it includes breakfast, though it now shows me as having booked two rooms and having three guests. Something is really wrong with this property.Bottom line: This hotel should not carry the Sheraton flag. With service like this, I recommend Starwood drop their association and invoke breach of contract clauses. I have a flyer from the hotel mentioning how this property was lauded by a business magazine in Asia. When I return from my next round of travel, I will be sending that magazine a courtesy copy of this letter, since they need to know how poor this property treats their guests. I am posting this to Flyertalk and TripAdvisor as well. I have never felt so strongly about poor treatment at any of my 500+ hotel stays. I did not sleep well there (noisy parties) or leave with breakfast (included in the rate) and was treated poorly the entire time, down to Manager Paul Yi鈥檚 assurance that he would contact me after I addressed my concerns with him. I think the entire amount of money I spent there should be refunded and the property should not carry the Sheraton flag.

<Content>Average Business Hotel, Good Location The Beijing Great Wall Sheraton is a nice property with excellent service and clean rooms and facilities. It is fairly central for activities in Beijing, making it attractive for business travelers and recreational travelers alike. The in-house restaurants are all good, and there is also a nice, cheap Chinese restaurant right behind the hotel (Great Wall Restaurant) that is a good dining option. The rooms are a bit small but not prohbitively so, my room on the 15th floor tended to be a little hot but I don't think they had switched the master air conditioner on yet as I was there in March. There is also a bit of a gap between the bottom of the door and the carpet in the floor hall, which allows noise from the hall in. But this was only an issue for me for one night and with the heater/ac unit it was pretty easy to drown out.I had meetings in a couple different office locations, and I also used some free time to visit the olympic site and the sites around the Forbidden City. The Great Wall Sheraton location made it pretty easy to get to all these locations.Although I much prefer the Beijing Kempinski, this is a decent property with no major issues or shortcomings. I would not hesitate to stay here again if heading back to Beijing.

<Content>Perfectly good business hotel When travelling on business I expect a hotel to be clean, functional and efficient. The GWS was all of these things and my brief stay was worthy of recommendation.I booked a deluxe room, but as an SPG gold card holder I was upgraded to a room on a higher floor. As the hotel is adjacent to a busy main road I think this was probably a good thing. I was told by a member of staff that all rooms are essentially the same throughout the hotel - not terribly large but clean, well equipped and perfectly adequate for the business traveller or short stay holidaymaker. Hotel is located in the business district and therefore fine for me, but if were in town for sightseeing I might choose an alternative closer to the centre. Beware that traffic in Beijing is abysmal and the shortest cab journeys take far longer than the distance would imply.I have seen bad reviews of the breakfast but again I found the buffet to be excellent quality and cosmopolitan - Asian cuisine on one bar, continental breakfasts on another and American favourites (eggs, bacon) on a third.Service throughout the hotel was exemplary - plenty of staff (many, many trainees) who were eager to please and always available. On the whole the GWS is a very good hotel - designed, I guess, predominantly for business people, but equally suitable for tourists wanting a good class hotel on a budget (RMB 2,100 for 2 nights). No great WOW factor, just a good all round hotel.

<Content>Not recommended at all !!! Very old and not modern, small rooms, small windows, low quality breakfast ... Surprised that Sheraton put their name and logo on this terrible property. Overall feels like a 3 star hotel. There are lots of better hotels in Beijing for this money.

<Content>Great Hotel We stayed a week in this hotel and I must say everything was perfect. The employees were very friendly and helpfull and they did there best to speak English. The room is very good and the food was excellent (especially the breakfasts are very special). Although a little bit early, the hotel was already in a fine and warm Christmas atmosphere. The location is also good, it is very easy (and cheap) to have a taxi to all places in Beijing (max 30 min to the forbidden city). We did not understand the bad rates in these reviews....

<Content>Stay away if you have any other choices!!! I go to Beijing on business at least four times a year and usually stay at the St. Regis Hotel, a different Starwood Property in Beijing, and one which I unconditionally endorse. I am a Platinum Starwood member because I try and stay at Starwood Hotels and unfortunately the St. Regis is closed as it renovates to get ready for the 2008 Olympics (Go Team USA!). Because the Westin was in a location remote for my business meetings I choose the Sheraton and was disappointed. The Sheraton was a typical big American Chain Hotel with mediocre service and all the small touches done cheap. I found the room (which they called a suite as I am supposed to be upgraded to a suite if any are available) to be tiny and the bathroom claustrophobic. If this is the suite I wonder what the normal rooms are like. I found the staff had very poor English and were extremely inflexible in dealing with my needs. They did not respond to things at check out and this is simply one of the poorest stays I have had in the last four years in any hotel!!! The St. Regis often has rates that are within 10 or 15$ of this Hotel and I would recommend you try that hotel if it has any space.

<Content>Sheraton Great Wall Dissapointing to say the least. This hotel was in my opinion is disgrace to the Sheraton name. We booked for 5 nights stay in which upon our arrival they mixed up our reservation. We had booked a King non-smoking room and they tried to place us in a smoking room. We addressed our concern to the front desk who said they were fully booked but if we wanted to pay extra we they did have a King non-smoking available. We eventually got our King non smoking after calling the corporate 1-800 and the room suddenly became available.The interior common area of the hotel was run down, dated and in need of renovations. The rooms we're slightly renovated with newer sheets but the walls, carpet, were dirty. The house cleaning was disappoint, upon our check out when we looked under the bed to discover a used condom wrapper. The locker room in the mens pool area was dirty, dusty and we found staff cutting their toe nails one night, another day making tea in the sink. We realize that the standards in China are different than North America but that's why we booked with a international chain so we can get these standards from home. My general recommendation is with the 2008 Olympics being built there are lots of new hotels being built in better locations. Find a newly built hotel and book with them.

<Content>Superb staff and a tightly run luxury hotel We have been lucky enough to stay in many 5* hotels around the world, and whilst this might not quite match the standards in some western countries, the staff were unhesitatingly helpful, friendly, (yet professional), and the whole operation was expertly steered by a delightful Palestinian gentleman when we visited. We will certainly be staying here again when we return.

<Content>Bedbugs I just returned from my first trip to Beijing. Being unfamiliar with the city, I thought booking at a well known US hotel would be a good idea...wrong. The cleanliness and service at the Sheraton here is the worst I've ever encountered. It has a bad smell, a loud sleazy lounge act that is noisy all the way up to the rooms, the carpets were stained in the hallways and rooms and the worst part is that there are bedbugs! I have huge itchy red spots all over my legs. The concierge didn't seem to have a clue and when I asked her to write directions to our office in Beijing (don't speak/write Mandarin) she wrote the wrong place down and I was left in the middle of nowhere far from our office. When I inquired about visiting the Great Wall all she could tell me was the travel tour office was closed. The traffic is horrendous, so unless you don't plan on leaving your room, don't count on getting anywhere in under an hour (it's way too far to walk, otherwise I would have done so) and this includes the trip to and from the airport-not just to see the sights or go elsewhere. I will never go back there and I've already advised our company to take it off the list of hotel options for our employees and clients. I'm a frequent traveler and this hotel is one of the worst I've stayed in....Starwood is really not the chain it used to be.

<Content>Nice Enough I stayed in The Great Wall Sheraton in early August 2007. I was on the Elite floor so I can't vouch for the standard rooms are like but my Elite room was clean, comfortable and well maintained. There was a very large three-way bathroom, big screen plasma television and excellent work desk. The dark wood used on some of the walls was a little heavy and made parts of the room very dark (you need night-vision googles to find things in the closet!).The Executive Floor breakfast buffet was not particularly good but you can have an omlette etc. if you ask.Overall the hotel is looking a little bit dated but its still OK and I enjoyed my stay.

<Content>Great Value for your money My husband and i had the pleasure of staying at Tianlun Dynasty Hotel in June as a stop over during our around the world tour this summer. Last year I went to Beijing and stayed at the Crown Plaza. While the room and service was decent, I elected to go with a hotel that was a bit more inexpensive but still in same area. Having read positive reviews for Tianlun Dynasty and saw it was in same area, I decided to go with it and was not disappointed. More than a few reviewers of this hotel mention the rooms facing the atrium and their annoyance at the music from piano in atrium lobby. Its worth noting that the Tianlun and Crown Plaza both had pianos in their atrium lobbies, which came alive during dinner. They had either a singer entertaining the dinner crowd or just music playing but at both hotels, music was over at a decent time to be able to sleep comfortably overnight. I understand the lure of western style Crown Plaza , however I dont think that the asian influenced style and service of Tianlun Dynasty should be a deterrent. If they refer to themselves as a 4 star hotel its because the rooms are clean, nicely sized, sufficient toiletries, prompt housekeeping services, fitness center and in room internet access. Yes the style is dated but i think thats part of the charm. as far as it being a smoking hotel--China is a smoking country. heck, the pollution in China overall is no secret and known worldwide--you can literally see the haze. as far as finding people who speak english in China in general is a task in itself. but still, when you travel, you manage to exchange information somehow and it helps to learn a few words in their language instead of us always expecting others around the world to speak our language. If you want boutique, chic trendy hotel, then dont stay here. Stay here if you want a hotel in a great location, within walking distance of Forbidden City, night market, shopping center and great value for your money. Furthermore, they have a killer lunch buffet. Here's where Tianlun beats Crown Plaza. The buffet has everything from grilled meats, all sorts of veggies, any fresh fruit and juices, even haggen daz ice cream. you can even have Peking duck everyday and its great--by the way the Quanjude Duck restaurant was way over-rated. Im from NY and Peking duck here is way better on any corner in chinatown. but i digress, i highly recommend this lovely hotel. also..if anyone is interested in using a private , patience and very personable driver who speaks decent english, feel free to contact me. we used him last year and again this time around. both times, he was always very professional and kind. great experience in china overall.

<Content>Would opt to stay in familiar Western chain hotel next time Stayed with large group at this hotel. Pros: *The location is terrific...near the night market and busy shopping district. Can walk everywhere. Felt safe in small groups or alone. *The huge internal atrium area where there is music, dining, bar area. Great place to sit, have a pot of green tea or a cocktail, connect to the internet and plan the next days event. *The desk agent on the executive lounge floor was very helpful (language a bit of a barrier) in translation English to Mandarin for taxi cards. Cons:*It is a smoking hotel and I had a hard time breathing and had a sore throat for several days. I had to open the windows to air out the room but my room was on the outside overlooking the church next door so noise and air pollution was a constant.*Poor English/communication from staff...from the front desk to the restaurants, it was impossible to communicate if you do not know minimal Mandarin. They were not able to give anyone a non-smoking room and did not appear eager to help resolve the complaints from non-smokers. *Rooms were dated and could have used a good cleaning. *There seemed to be some questionable activities going on with the karaoke bars and lounges which we learned were not run/managed by the hotel but rather third party. It gave the hotel a bit of a questionable atmosphere.

<Content>Four stars is a joke This is definitely not a four-star facility by any definition. Rooms were small and fixtures and furniture dated. Lobby layout and materials were old and sagging. Staff in general were fine though service and attitude were distinctly inferior to Hong Kong. Location is good. This problem of overrating hotels is endemic in the PRC. The only hotels that reasonably correspond to their ratings are those that are of western origin. I most likely will not stay here again.

<Content>Beijing by foot We chose this hotel because the price was reasonable and the location was near the Imperial Palace. The hotel was much nicer than we had expected for the price. It had a lovely, huge inner atrium which was especially nice in the winter. The room was satisfactory. But what we liked most was being able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. We only had to take the subway once, to a distant duck restaurant. To stay within our budget, we didn't eat at the hotel. Instead we found noodle shops (with pictures) within a block of the hotel.

<Content>Tianlun Dynasty is a great hotel I want to recommend the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel. It turned out to be a great choice. Location is fabulous, next to the main commercial shopping area and walking distance to Tianamen Square and the Forbidden City. It is not on the American hotel circuit, so it has an international clientele, which we prefer. Has a beautiful central atrium--complete with palm trees and fountains and soft music in the evening--which provides a lovely haven from the rigors of Beijing street life. Yes, perhaps its a bit tacky, but still a nice environment. Warning: make sure you get an outside room, with street exposure, rather than on this atrium. Other reviews have warned that you can hear the music at night, and I think it is probably true. If you can splurge, reserve a higher floor, with open views. We had a lovely view of the Forbidden City on the 10th floor. This is the Executive Floor, a bit more expensive, but you get free breakfast, so I believe it evens out. (We got a good deal on hotels.com) The staff is lovely, although not many speak much English, which is true of Beijing in general and part of the experience. But the concierge was able to write where we wanted to go in Chinese so that we could show it to the cab driver, and the travel desk was very helpful. We booked a car and guide from the hotel for days when we wanted to have an easier time getting around.

<Content>great stay had a great 2 night stay at this hotel. Great location, very clean spacious rooms with huge bed , seating area and smart bathroom. The staff were very friendly, helpful and spoke good English.We were only in for breakfast which had a good selection of foods.We ordered room service the night we got there and had the most delicious club sandwiches ever!!Unfortunately, we did not even see the pool area due to the time constraints of our trip but would definately recommend this hotel.It is a 30 minute walk, 5 min taxi ride, from Tiananmen Square .

<Content>Great Service! I stayed at Tianlun Dynasty Hotel for a week during the end of February. I would recommend it to anyone!- The service was very friendly and reliable. Most of the staff had knowledge of English and a few were very fluent.- My room was spacious and very clean. I upgraded my room to the executive floor and the extras were worth it. There's a lounge with coffee and finger foods available at certain times and there's always an employee on standby to help with your room if needed.- Hotel location was excellent and couldn't have been any better.- I ate at the hotel restaurants a couple of times...it was a little pricey, but the quality of the food was well worth the money.Food tips: - Try the peking duck in the restaurant in the basement. Pricing is moderate and it tastes great!- If you get room service, try the club sandwich!I will stay at this hotel the next time I'm back in Beijing.

<Content>perfect Location I stayed here in Feb 2007. I found the location was great and the staff were really helpful. The room was very clean and spacious with the biggest bed I have ever seen. The courtyard is lovely for having a relaxing evening drink but be warned its not cheap. The same is said for the mini bar it was madly over priced but you get that in every hotel. There is a shop just across the road where you can get drinks for your room at a 10th of the price. I would defiantly stay here again.

<Content>One of the nicest hotels i have been to in China I stayed at this hotel for 3 days on business. The staff was very friendly and could all speak relatively decent english with some staff being able to speak proficiently. I think a few of the workers went to school in canada, austrailia, and the USA. The facilities were very clean and service was excellent. The highlight of the stay is the big open concept courtyard in the middle of the hotel. I spent a fair amount of time just relaxing and enjoying the environment.I stayed on the dynasty floor (10th floor) which offers guests alot of vip services such as conference center, coffee and drinks and snacks, its own receptionist, english magazines and newspapers, and discounts at the restaurants.There are alot of restaurants to choose from at the hotel. I think there was at least 3 chinese cuisine restaurants alone. shanghai style, hunan style with peking duck and an upscale cantonese restaurant with shark fin soup and abalone. The restaurants are not cheap but the food is delicious.I would come back here on vacation in beijing. There are many historic sites and shopping districts very close to the hotel. pricing listed on their website is pretty high but u can book the hotel for a fair price on most online hotel booking websites.i wish i brought my camera to take pictures of the hotel. There was a few special events happening and the decorations were unbelievable.

<Content>Tianlun Dynasty-A great hotel We stayed in the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel in Beijing for 5 days after a 12 day cruise. I must say we enjoyed our stay in Beijing and this hotel more than the cruise. The hotel room (9th floor) was large, clean, and comfortable. The hotel service was great. People at the desk and guest services spoke English and were most accommodating. Anyone who couldn't understand what we wanted quickly ran to get someone who did. We didn't take advantage of their many services but did go to 2 of their restaurants and 3 tours they offered. The hotel is beautiful and right on Wangfujing Street. (The main street in Beijing) Taxis were not expensive in Beijing but the drivers knew no English. The ones we used were very nice and the hotel doorman told them where we wanted to go. (Always carry your hotel name and address written in Chinese to show the driver) on your way home.We would stay there again if ever in Beijing and would recommend it to everyone.

<Content>Average tourist hotel - but good for China w/ a great location The Tianlun Dynasty Hotel is located centrally in the center of Beijing on Wangfujing Street. Our tour guide claimed it to be a 5-star hotel, which perhaps for China, it is; however, it is definitely not a 5-star hotel. It IS a good hotel - comparable to a Sheraton and the likes and has most of the standard hotel amenities. The staff is cordial and the biggest plus is that hotel guests get 10 minutes of internet access at the business center free (after that, it's 2 yuan per minute or about 25 cents per minute). The buffet breakfast at the hotel is ok - has your standard western breakfast (eggs made to order, cereals, various breads  danishes, bacon, sausage ...) as well as some Chinese food (rice porridge, dim sum, etc). But overall, the breakfast isn't as good as some other breakfasts at hotels in China. Overall, a good hotel for tourists looking for a central location and decent rooms (clean, decently appointed, enough Chinese  international TV stations, private bath, mini-bar, etc.).

<Content>Comfortable stay My Husband and I were in Beijing for a conference and spent 8 nights at the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel. We opted to stay in the city and taxi to the conference center north of the city. This hotel is in an excellent location. It is a 2 km walk to Tian'anmen Square and the Forbidden City and a 5 min taxi ride to the Silk Market, Temple of Heaven and other popular attractions. The hotel sits on Wangfujing Dajie a main shopping street with several malls and stores. Plus, there is a grocery store across the street in the basement of one of the malls where you can purchase large bottles of water and snacks. The hotel concierge will write out cards for you in Chinese to give to your taxi to drive you anywhere in the city. Buy a city map ahead of time and be prepared for the taxi to shuttle you all around the city to take you to your destination 2 blocks away. We took full advantage of the food options available at Tianlun. The buffets are pricey, but it was a great way for my husband to try some more adventurous cuisine. Our main complaint with the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel is similar to others; the walls are thin and it can seem a bit noisy at times. Since the a/c was on almost the entire time, it offered white noise, which masked some of the noise in the hallway and on the street. The staff are very helpful and speak English well. Don't expect this to be a 5 star hotel. If you want newer and fancier, book a room across the street at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, which is on the higher end of accomodations. That said, we found the Tianlun Dynasty Hotel very comfortable and a great price for its location and services.

<Content>Great location, great stay We spent 4 nights here and it was the perfect base for our stay in Beijing. Great location in the heart of busy shopping district. Room was really comfortable and all the staff were very friendly. Music from the courtyard was noticeable at first but we soon blanked it out. Good breakfast buffet too. Nice calm hotel in very busy city !

<Content>Good Choice for Short Stay I enjoyed a 3 day stay here recently. As other folks mention they have a courtyard with classical music. The local is pretty good as well.Yes, the music does get annoying after a few days but the rooms are good quality and most importantly I was able to get the room for $125/night.If you're going for 2-3 days a good choice at $125.

<Content>Excellent Hotel...... Spent 6 nights at the hotel. Great location close to restaurants, shopping and 10 min walk form TS. Hotel is well run. Room was very comfortable. The courtyard (center of the hotel) is very nice in the evening when they serve a buffet and have live classical music. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My only complaint is the breakfast buffet. It is decent but not nearly as sumptutious as I found in some less expensive hotels. I would definitely stay there again.

<Content>Excellent Great hotel  centrally located! Extremely pleased with my stay. Well-maintained rooms. Excellent service  helpful staff. Executive floor with limited view of forbidden city  complimentary continental breakfast, evening appetizers and drinks (although breakfast buffet included in rate). Very pleased with my stay. Given the bad experience I encountered with the Prime Hotel (also listed as a 4 star hotel), I could not believe the diffence in service  accommodations!

<Content>A good Hotel Was offered by Crowne plaza to stay in this hotel after Crowne plaza failed to open on 1/11/05. This hotel is directly oposite the Cowne plaza. Stayed for 3 nights in TianLun Dynasty. A very good hotel, excellent rooms, specially requested prior to booking, twin beded room and was given 1 large bed (5') and 1 large single (4') which was fine with us as we have 2 adults and 1 child. Their standard twin beded room is 2 no of single beds. Front desk is very helpful and efficient, Concige was strong and house keeping is very good. Plus point, in room dining is 24 hours ordered a very good Hainan chicken rice for supper. Location is very good, Macdonalds, Bakery is a short 3 minutes walk away in Tong An market complex. The hawker street is just 3 minutes walk away. Would recomend anyone to stay there. Only minus point is that there is no direct access to this hotel from Wang fu zing. you would have to walk to a side lane to enter through the main entrance.

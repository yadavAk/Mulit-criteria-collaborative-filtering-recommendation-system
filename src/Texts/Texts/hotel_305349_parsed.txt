<Content>Agreeable Accommodations Reservations at this state guest house were part of an extended tour but the arrangements more than met our needs on this first stop in China. Room was well appointed with quality bedding and bath products, robes, and slippers. Staff members were knowledgeable and very accommodating, particularly with transormer/adapter needed for 110v appliances, when our multi-purpose unit would not fit sockets. Location is close to department store with basement food court but not in the heart of shopping area.

<Content>Not impressed! I travelled to Beijing for business and stayed at the Presidential for 2 nights, booked through my company. After reading all the good reviews I was looking forward to my short stay, however I was disappointed... Checkin was fast and efficient but not friendly. I didnt find my room to be very clean and found hair in both the basin and bath tub!! I decided to have dinner with my 2 colleagues at the Garden cafe and food was not that good and my malaysian laksa, apart from being really bland, came with spaghetti and not noodles. On the last day, had breakfast in my room and again not good. I ordered the american breakfast and it came without the bread, butter, jam and pastries.And they advertise themselves as the best 5 star in west Beijing - no way!

<Content>Beware of leaving cash in the gift shop for postage. Very pleasant experience with one exception. The gift shop stated they out of postage and if I would leave cash, the stamps would be purchased at the post office and my post cards would be mailed for me. I had a number of cards and left the saleslady approximately equivalent of $14+ US dollars for the postage. While cards mailed from other locations across China, arrived at their destinations, not one of the cards left in the hotel gift shop were ever received.

<Content>Can't wait to return I can think of no better compliment to pay the Presidential Plaza than to spread the word that it must be the best hotel in Beijing. When our tour of 19 souls arrived late that evening in April, tired and weary after a long flight from North America, we were immediately shown to the escalator where our check-in was fast tracked through the reception desk on the second floor. Thoroughly enjoyed my room with the double bed, safe, tea things and the multi -channel television. It was quiet in the room and everything worked. There was plenty of bottled water to drink but I boiled the water from the tap to make my tea so I could use the bottled water (along with mouthwash I'd brought from home) to clean my teeth. Thought the colourful black and white mugs added a special touch to the everyday tea tray. We stayed at the Presidential four nights - mostly we ate our lunch and dinner when we were out and about touring the city but our tour did have one dinner in the Nile Room of the hotel. My journal says that it was quite the banquet. Found the front desk staff to be very polite and welcoming towards me each time and goodness knows I had reason enough to bother them with buying stamps, changing money, asking for directions etc. Not once was I ignored, sloughed off or given insufficient information. Enjoyed my breakfasts in the Garden Cafe off the lobby. Lots to eat and plenty of it. Liked the fact I could slice my own bread from the variety on offer. Like everything else, the early bird gets the worm and I found that having my breakfast before 8 a.m., to avoid the mainstream crowd, resulted in a good seat by the window.There was shopping within walking distance of the hotel. About a 10 minute walk away if you stop and gawk at the traffic. Less than that if you head straight for the pedestrian overpass. It was a delight to find the market with the colourful vendors and their merchandise at the ready in the Bank of Beijing building. I went through the breezeway and entered through the rear of the building. Think it was up on the third floor. The doorman at the hotel will give you a little map of directions if you ask him. Very obliging. Perhaps because I was on a tour we were treated differently but I can hardly believe that. I think the employees at the Presidential are just a well-trained fine bunch of people and I can hardly wait to return in two years for more of the same hospitality and service. Try saying ni hao (hello) or Zaoshang hao (Good morning) to the staff. You will be pleasantly surprised to get their response.

<Content>Definitely NOT a 5-star hotel The room was clean and neat but this is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel. The breakfast was done in western style and the same everyday. However, the waiters and waitresses left much to be desired. They were slow in service, showed no acknowledgment of your request and liked to throw the things (i.e. spoons, sugar, etc) on your table. Even a 3-star hotel in Bangkok is much much better!

<Content>I agree not 5 star but not bad either Stayed here for 3 nights. My room on the 12th floor was so dark I could not read even during the day. Otherwise the room was ok with mini-bar, satisfactory bathroom, safe etc. There was no iron but the laundry service was efficient.Did not visit the pool or jacuzzi so cannot comment. The staff struggled with English which could be quite annoying at times. I particularly had a problem trying to order a drink in the Lobby Lounge. Otherwise the standard of food was ok.The location is good as it is very near to a Subway station and a large department store with a supermarket underneath.If staying again I would try and reserve a room finishing with an odd number as these are on the sunny side (smog allowing).

<Content>Okay Hotel but not a 5 star We stayed in the hotel for 5 days as part of group tour. The hotel is not a western 5 star hotel.The main problem I found in the hotel was with the pool and Jacuzzi area. The day I visited the leisure facility but the Jacuzzi was very dirty. I raised the issue with the pool attendant and was advised that it had been very busy so that seems to be an excuse not to have it cleaned. It should have been closed down. I was told to come back the next day and it would be ok. I raised this issue with the manager on call at the reception and was told something similar. I decided that I would give the leisure facility a miss after that.The food in the restaurant on the ground floor for breakfast was fine. We ate in that restaurant one evening and the food was ok. Some of the food was not very hot (which was the same in a lot of places in China).Our room was ok. We asked for a non smoking room on check in and initially were told there were none available but were then given a room on a smoking floor.The room itself was a nice size and the bathroom was lovely. There was a bit of a smell in the room when you went in and te carpet was a bit dirty. We did mention this to tour guide and to be fair we were offered a larger room after 2 days.I would check the room provided on check in and ensure that you are happy with in. A number of people in our group had problems with their rooms and changed rooms during the trip.We ate in the Italian Restaurant on the first floor on our own one evening and the food was fine but the portions were quite small. We ate in the same place the following night with a group and the food was fine.Our tour found a small bar around the corner from the hotel which was more reasonable than drinking in the bar. The doorman was welcoming and excellent in terms of taxi and sorting out any issues.We used the metro to \ from the hotel. It is about 5 minutes walk from the hotel and was a very good way of getting about. Taxis are also very cheap in Beijing.

<Content>Okay for Groups This was the final hotel on our Pacific Delights Tours 13 day journey. We spent 3 night here.The hotel has some good points. The Breakfast buffet was great. The staff was excellent and very hard working. Gym was great with a good number of machines, separate weight room and dance area. Pool looked nice. Did not see the sauna, hot tub or steam room.The property is in the West side of town in a mixed residential and commerical area. A 24 hour McDonald's is around the corner as well as Sizzler's and a few pizza outlets If you are looking for groceries to stock up, the department store on the main street has a suoermarket in the basement level. Buy your beer and chips here, it's cheaper than the hotel.The rooms are a little tired though. The first room we got had a dirty carpet and we couldn't get the safe to work. The second room we got was slightly better. I don't remember if the TV was a LCD or not but the entertainment cabinets in both rooms were nicked. The room we ended up in also had sheer drapes that were not clean. Buyer beware of the pedicure or massage services offerered on the fourth floor of the hotel by multiple third party vendors. There are in room flyers offering good values and discounts but make sure you ask when you arrive downstairs to get the correct price.My wife encountered this problem after a less than satisfactory pedicure treatment. After having complained to the manager, she received a full refund of the difference between the advertised price and the price she paid. Another member of our group also had a similar problem with her massage charges.Yes, we would stay there again, but perhaps check out the Executive Club level or wait until they do a full remodel of the the property.

<Content>Different experience when travelling independently IWe stayed in this hotel for eight nights as part of a tour group and our room was very spacious. Service was fine as regards the front desk and the breakfast but a comment must be made about the bar, where a wait of fifteen minutes for a pint was not uncommon. The pool was also very nice and overall it was a pleasant stay.Me and my patner then went travelling independently and when we returned a week later, my opinion was turned on its head. I can understand that a room may not be ready for an eleven o'clock check in but we arrived at 1.30 and were told that it would be ready in 25 minutes and we got a voucher for a small drink. We let them have more time and came back 45 minutes later to be told that it was stil not ready. One of the receptionists was going to write another voucher before the manager came and tore it up and told us to sit down and wait in the lobby in a most rude manner. Obviously we said we are not budgeing.On to our new room. The window faced onto a service lane with a wall three feet from our window and that was it. The room was about a fifth the size of the one we had previously occupied. The following morning at check out they did not give me back my deposit and only for I remembered would never have gotten back.So in conclusion, if with a tour group this hotel is pleasant, but when travlling independently it is a debacle and to be avoided.

<Content>Amazing! I have just returned from a 9 night stay in this hotel and i have to say it was outstanding. All the staff were extremely courteous and polite and eager to help. The rooms were extremely comfortable and room service did a fantastic job daily.I only had one complaint during my stay here and that was Sophia's restaurant. I found the staff quite unfriendly and unwilling to help. Other than that, the staff throughout the hotel and leisure centre were marvellous and made my stay there a pleasure.

<Content>Excellent hotel The hotel is large and new and reflects the new China. The staff all speak basic English ,some better than others. There is even a member of staff to open the automatic door just before you need it!The concierge was very helpful about finding different places in the city and giving advise. As you get into a taxi (extremely cheap by the way) the doorman gives you a slip of paper with the taxi number on it which makes it traceable. The rooms are clean and there is complimentary bottled water every day tho all the hotel water is treated.My only small complaint was that room service was a bit slow but as the waiter was charmingly apologetic,I smiled and said -no problem! The shops within the hotel are good, tho the staff are rather determined to make a sale ( remember to haggle) My husband got an excellent made- to -measure suit in 48hrs(200euros). Altogether a pleasant experience as was our visit to China

<Content>Very Mediocre - not a Presidential experience My husband and I stayed here on the second length of a two part trip to China. Our initial stay was with the Mayfair Hotel in Shanghai and because we enjoyed this experience so much this hotel had a lot to live up to鈥?.but unfortunately fell short of the mark for us.Again we had paid for an upgrade, but there was an issue with our booking when we arrived and we were given an ordinary room. When we questioned this and insisted that we be upgraded to the Executive Suite as paid for (through our travel agent) 鈥?the girl on reception told us that they had no up grades, all the rooms were the same!In the lift the floors were all numbered with the 15th clearly labeled 鈥淓xecutive Floor鈥? We advised her of this, but she stuck to her original statement. On getting quite upset with our tour guide, he asked to speak with the Duty Manager who began down the same route, but conceded when we invited him to come and view the floor names in the lift and requested to see the rooms on this elusive floor! We eventually got our suite, but the shine had been taken off the experience due to the hour that we had spent arguing to try and secure it. Whilst the rooms were nicely decorated 鈥?they were not as comfortable, or well laid out as the previous hotel. It would seem that the suites were two standard rooms knocked into one. There were two separate bathrooms, a good sized bedroom and a lounge area. The bathrooms were not what I would have expected from a five star hotel with plastic shower curtains and terrible water pressure. Whilst there was air conditioning in the room, it never really cooled the air and we resorted to opening the windows on a couple of occasions (this was in October). The mini bar was not as well stocked or regularly replenished as previously (1 can of beer, 1 bottle of gin鈥?) and our bill was incorrectly calculated on departure where the hotel had tried to charge us for water which we had bought ourselves and had simply put into the fridge to cool!We had access to the executive lounge and again this was poorly run. We waited quite some time on a number of occasions to get a drink and when we asked if we could use the check out service in the lounge they tried to fob us off to the main reception until we questioned why. When we did come to check out, it took over 20 minutes due to a litany of errors trying to check out the previous guest and our incorrect room bill. Beware of the prices in the bars 鈥?really expensive, evening compared to Irish prices (a JD and splash of coke was over 鈧?1 compared to 鈧? in a local bar!!) and there is a 15% service charge on top of all quoted prices. All in all we can鈥檛 say that it was a bad hotel 鈥?but it was not what you would expect from a 5*. It is an older, State owned hotel and the staff are not as friendly as those which you experience elsewhere in Beijing. Oh, and beware of the Presidential lounge where you get charged for the pleasure of the ladies company!Tip 鈥?If you get the chance, definitely visit Tiananmen Sq, the Summer Palace, the Great Wall and Beijing zoo. Also 鈥?visit the department stores for really high quality seconds and prices to die for!

<Content>Meh, It's Not Run by Westerners This was my first hotel stay on my first trip to China. I was very impressed with the outside and lobby of the hotel. But my stay went downhill from there. The room was decently appointed, but nothing spectacular. The furnishings and carpet in our room and the hall showed signs of age and wear. We had an odd extra room in our room that was accessed through a sliding glass door. It was completely bare, smelled funny and looked very worn. Our room was the last one on the hall. No one else in our group seemed to have this extra purposeless room.My biggest complaint was with the level of service. I think there was some kind of political summit between China and Russia going on at the time, so perhaps the staff was overwhelmed. However, they just didn't seem to care about the most basic of things. They never left a wash cloth. I know that's a cultural thing, but they are trying to cater to international customers. On more than one occasion, the fresh toiletry bottles on our bathroom counter were completely empty. I had to wait 20 minutes to have a tiny bottle of shampoo delivered. Again, perhaps it is a cultural thing that they don't expect a guest to wash their hair every day, but I do.The breakfast buffet was included in our tour package. There was plenty of good food. My only complaint was that I recall the buffet room being really, really hot. The next hotel we used, a Sheraton in Xi'an, was run by a Western company. I immediately saw the difference in customer service. This hotel would not have seemed as bad if I had not gone directly to a Western-run establishment.Here's a link to a photo I took of the stunning lobby:http://farm1.static.flickr.com/194/447824190_132e8603a4_b.jpg

<Content>Greate Hotel and Excellent Service I only stayed in this hotel one night, but I left my luggage at the hotel mid-morning and went for a day exploring, and when I got back my room was ready and was immediately taken to it. The room was extremely clean and comfortable, as was the hotel itself, and the main reception area was great to sit and read in. The staff were extremely attentive, and a lone woman traveller I felt safe in the hotel, however it was off the beaten track and I wouldn't have felt particularly comfortable walking about the area on my own. But excellent service was given, English was spoken and check in and out was smooth and fast.

<Content>Not so Presidential Plaza We stayed here last week while in Beijing. The hotel lobby is really nice. Though the concierges are a little pushy when you ask them for help. For example, when we wanted to visit the Great Wall, they pushed hard for us to use the hotel driver, saying it would be impossible for us to hire a regular taxi. This may have been the case, but we took the hotel car instead, because we felt so uneasy. They also pushed their acrobats show on us rather than help us book tickets to the show we wanted to attend.The halls have a really strong smell that I didn鈥檛 like. The room was nice, clean, but the bed was uncomfortable. They gave us bottled water each day and there is plenty of water in the health club where you can refill your bottles each morning before heading out for the day. The shower was either extremely hot or extremely cold, nothing in the middle.Overall I would say that this is a nice hotel, not 5 stars, maybe 4. But has a definite 鈥渙ld鈥?feeling about it. And not 鈥渙ld鈥?in a charming way.I would stay here if the location is convenient for you, otherwise I might recommend a more 鈥淎merican鈥?style chain property.

<Content>The staff really tries hard Located away from the main sights, the Presidential Plaza was probably at one time, the best, premier hotel in Beijing. The lobby is well appointed but the rooms are a little tired. One of the reviewers mentioned an odd, musty smell in the hallways, and that is the case. But despite all of that, the staff at the hotel is exceptionally curteous, competent and, frankly, they try so hard to please. To get to most sights in Beijing, one has to take a taxi (which are plentiful except at rush hour and are very inexpensive), so the location is not that great of a minus. The surrounding neighborhood is very Chinese, so it's authentic...for better or worse, it's not like the area around the Peninsula or the Grand Hyatt. Plus, the room rates are considerably less than that at either of the aforementioned hotels.So it boils down to a trade off between slightly tired rooms, with a musty hallway odor and a staff and team that is exceptionally helpful and without an attitude.

The pool facilities were great with free towels, robes, slippers etc provided. There is also jaccuzi, sauna, golf on site among other amenities.The Garden Cafe provided us with a great buffet breakfast every morning with several palates catered for (American, European, Asian.) My boyfriend and I also ate at the Dynasty Jade Garden restaurant and had a fantastic dinner there. Staff were incredibly helpful, polite and attentive.

<Content>Only so so Actually writing this review at this hotel as we speakWill stay total 2 nights, the room is okay overall, with separate shower / bath, which is nice.Price paid was nice, RMB 700 per night inclusive of breakfastBut the downside to this hotel is that it is a bit old, and so sometimes you can smell the old hotel odor in the corridors going to your room...And a word of advice, DO NOT accept floors between the 5 to 8th floor and facing the indside of the hotel! I am staying on the 6th floor and there is a banquet rehearsal going now, and so it is quite noisy...But the service over-all is good...but the cream wild mushroom soup from room service really sucked...So over-all, only 50 / 50 in my opinion

<Content>Great hotel, good location!!! We stayed in this hotel from December 30th untill January 3th during our tour through China. At the time we arrived in Beijing were we already more than two weeks in China and had stayed in several hotels. This was definately the best one we stayed in during our entire trip.The entrance is nice, and the lobby is beautiful. The rooms were clean, and overall the staff was very friendly. Only at the frontdesk, was it sometimes difficult to get what you needed due the poor English, or somewhat strange ways of providing service (trying to serve a second guest while you are dealing with them). Fortunately, there were often Westeners or good English speakers behind the frontdesk, who were very helpfull.Also, the staff wished us happy new year! Believe me, in China, this means something!The location is also very good! It's located two blocks from the subway which carries you in a few minutes to all major attractions!Great hotel, can recommend it. But please keep in mind that you are in China!

<Content>Great hotel, excellent staff After reading mixed reviews about this hotel I thought I should add something after my experience.I stayed here at the end of October 2006 for 2 nights as an extension to a Princess Cruise in the region. All I can say is this hotel is excellent, clean, spacious and full of very friendly staff.I can鈥檛 understand reviewer鈥檚 comments complaining about staff not speaking English, this hotel is in China! Would a Chinese person visiting the USA expect hotel staff to speak fluent Chinese? I think not. Having said that, there are a number of reception desks for porters, currency exchange and main reception and I spoke to staff on all those desks, they all spoke very good English with a smile and they couldn鈥檛 do enough to help, so I have nothing but praise for the staff in this hotel.Our room on the 9th floor was spacious and very, very quiet. Complimentary bottles of water, slippers and bathrobes were a great touch. The shower was hot and wet, and there were more toiletries than we knew what to do with. Beds were clean and comfortable, but the room could have benefited from better lighting. Oh, watch out for the lift (elevator) doors, they close quickly.Breakfast was adequate, cereals, hot and cold milk, plenty of pastries and cooked food, fruit, and tea, coffee and juices. We ate out in the evenings, so can鈥檛 comment on the evening meals.Those are the basic facts, I wasn鈥檛 expecting it to be so nice, or the staff to be so friendly and helpful, but it was, and they were. If you are staying here, I hope your experience is as good. planet.express@yahoo.com

<Content>This is a nice hotel! We just returned from a two week tour of China that included a stay at the Presidential Plaza. The bottom line is that this is a very nice hotel. After reading some of the earlier negative reviews, we also were concerned about the quality of this hotel. However, we were surprised and pleased to find out how plush it was. This is a high quality hotel -- beautiful interior spaces, etc. Because of the earlier negative reviews, we decided before even getting to the hotel that we would upgrade up an executive level room. Our tour guide called ahead and arranged it, after indicating to us that we had a choice of several upgrade packages, each at a different cost increase. We chose the least expensive upgrade which cost $25. Our room was excellent, and as nice as any hotel on the trip. Our upgrade included happy hour drinks and hors d'ouvres and continental breakfast in the 15th floor lounge. It did not include breakfast in the cafe; but rather with our tour group in the standard buffet. We decided to stick with the buffet, and it was OK but not great. If I could add the cafe breakfast for another $5-10, I probably would do that.The hotel also is near the city's subway line, a shopping center, and several restaurants; all one block away. So if your tour has you booked into this hotel, don't fret. I heard no complaints from anyone in our tour group about their room.

<Content>Glad I stayed with this hotel. I read the reviews of several hotels before going to Beijing, and was quite hesitant about the Presidential Plaza after digesting the previous posts. However, we two middle aged ladies just returned (to CA and TN) after spending 10 days in China, which included a most enjoyable 3-night stay in this hotel. All the front desk people I encountered spoke very good English, and were immensely helpful and polite. I asked about an upgrade and, yes, it's more expensive now. The rooms don't look quite like the internet pix, but that's true of most things online. Rooms were spotless, comfortable, and quiet ... and even the non-Executive floors had down pillows, robes, and slippers. We asked for extra towels and they arrived within minutes, piping hot! The pool was wonderful after a 9-hour sight seeing day, and there was unlimited free drinking water in the locker room if you didn't want to walk 2-blocks to the store. The 90 minute massage was great, and quite a deal at $24. The business center offers 15 internet minutes and a drink for $3 and the staff there couldn't have been nicer. I had trouble using a pre-paid Chinese phone card, and they took a lot of time helping me through. Breakfast was diverse and plentiful; the challenge was not choosing too much ... the only time we really encountered the tour groups was at breakfast, and at The Forbidden City, but, hey, the town was big enough for everyone. We had an early flight out on our last day (who knew that the sun was already well into the sky at 4:30am!), and they packed us a complimentary to-go breakfast. I'd totally recommend the Presidential Plaza to anyone who doesn't expect hotels and hotel staff in China to be exactly like hotels and hotel staff Stateside.

<Content>Upgrade is now very expensive I read an earlier post about the upgrade costing only $24 per night to go from a superior room to a superior room on the Executive Levels. Althought the US Dollar has not changed much against the Chinese Yuan since that posting, it now costs about $56 per night.

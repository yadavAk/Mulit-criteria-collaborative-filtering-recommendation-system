<Content>Worst Place I've attempted to stay in!! I booked this hotel for its proximity to the Superdome. I was in town attending the Sugar Bowl. Checking in was easy enough. As soon as I got to the room I noticed they gave me a room with two full beds, not the one king I reserved. I immediately went back down to the front desk and asked to change rooms. They denied my request for that night but promised to do it the next. After returning to my room I entered the bathroom and noticed 2 ants crawling around. I killed them and thought nothing more about it. My wife and I then called for room service to order chips and dip, some pasta and a steak. Upon answering the phone they informed us that they had run out of the chips and dip, then when asked about the pasta they said the chef is too busy, and doesn't want to cook that. Pick something else. We just hung up the phone at that point. I then went to check out the balcony, as we were on the 11th floor I thought it would be nice. However, the door was SCREWED shut! At this point we decided to call it a night after all the frustration. I took the comforter off the bed and we found more ants IN THE BED! I called the front desk and told them about the ants and that i wanted a new room immediately, they again denied my request. At this point we decided to just move on to another place. After an hour of arguing with the front desk we only got $313 back out of the $722 we spent for the 4 nights, without even staying a night.You do not want to stay here! Trust me!We ended up staying at Hotel St. Pierre in the French Quarter which was so much better......it ended up being a great vacation after a terrible Holiday INN start!GO UTES!!! NATIONAL CHAMPS

<Content>not too good I stayed at this hotel for the Sugar Bowl. I picked it strictly due to location as it is right by the Superdome. The experience was not very good at all. Checking in was a lengthy, painful process, the and elevators were extremely slow. The worst part was the restaurant and shuttle service. You had to stand at the reception desk forever to get acknowledged even though there were plenty of empty tables. You had to request a drink and refills multiple times before you would get them, and the food was not all that great. The shuttle is supposed to leave on the hour every hour. We waited by an empty shuttle bus until 20 minutes past the hour along with about 25 people. The bus only holds 14, so the driver explained he would be back for the others in 15 minutes. Those of us who did get on got to listen to the driver complain the whole trip. The rooms were fine and the bar seemed OK. From what I can tell, they just need a little management to get service up to par and they may be OK.

<Content>Great Sugar Bowl stay. My wife and I stayed at the Holiday Inn Superdome for the Sugar Bowl. The hotel was booked solid, but I was able to secure a good rate from my local AAA office, who booked a block of rooms for the game. The hotel had obviously been refurbished since Katrina. Everything was very clean and well-maintained. The bed was comfortable. The staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The breakfast buffet was standard fare, but tasted good. The hotel is situated to where the French Quarter is an easy walk (20 minutes), but far enough away to get some sleep. There is a great sandwich shop called The Store about 3 blocks down the street which is open for breakfast and lunch. The hotel is only a couple of blocks to the Superdome and Arena, so if you are in town for a game or concert, it would be an ideal place to stay. The only hiccup was trying to use the shuttle to go to the French Quarter took longer than walking, albeit because traffic was awful. Just something to think about during special events.

<Content>Bayou Classic My husband and I stayed here for the Bayou Classic weekend. The hotel was nice and clean but the room we stayed in was very small even though we had a king size bed. The carpet was old but it was clean. There was no refrigerator or microwave in the room. The toilet did not flush properly. You had to flush over and over for the toilet to clear. The complimentary breakfast was very scarce. All that was available for breakfast was juice, milk, cereal, coffee(not good), fruit and some stale bread. The restaurant downstairs was a bit pricey but I'm sure that is because of it's location in the city. The staff was very kind and friendly. The view from our balcony was not great because all we could see was the ruins from Hurricane Katrina. The bed was fabulous. The parking was pricey but it was very convenient.I would stay at this hotel again but they need to improve on their complimentary breakfast.

The rooms were REALLY nice and CLEAN. The place is much nicer than a lot of other Holiday Inns. I was told they have done a lot of work on the place lately. I highly recommend it.

<Content>nice friendly stay Stayed two nights and really enjoyed the staff and the facilities. Nice rooftop pool, great lounge with bar. Was on executive levels and it included breakfast and evening snacks. Shuttle was a great help as the hotel is abit away from center of French Quarter. You can walk to French Quarter but I wouldn't do so late night. Parking is expensive at $19 tax included. You can park in open lot just around corner for $5-10 based on day of week. Would go back again as the hotel rate was very reasonable and the staff seemed to really care. Good hotel restaurant. Nilitary police are still staying at this hotel, made family feel extra safe and they shared some amazing stories with us.

<Content>The absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed at. We basically had no other option in staying. We stayed one night and left first thing in the morning. There was a party next door to us which turned into an all-night domestic violence dispute. There was constant banging on our door all night. The room was filthy the water pressure came and went. There was dried blood on the pillow cases. This place is a complete dump.

<Content>Perfectly Fine Hotel We stayed at this hotel during Jazz Fest weekend, and I have to tell you it was perfectly acceptable. The double room was plenty big for the 4 of us (Adults) that shared the room - they even had 2 sinks, one in the restroom  one outside the restroom that helped speed up the process of the four of us getting ready to go out. It was about a 10 minute or so walk to Burbon Street, but with a group it didn't seem scary walking to or from the hotel at any hour. You know that when your coming to New Orleans, it's not to stay in the hotel and order room service - so the limited amount of time we spent in the room was fine. The beds were comfortable, and clean and we didn't have any problems at all with the hotel or it's staff. Our television remote wasn't working, and they brought a new one up right away, and we called to order more towels  they were timely in bringing them. Overall, a good experience.

<Content>Rude  We stayed at the Holiday Inn Superdome while in New Orleans for the V-Day 10th anniversary celebration. When trying to check in the hotel manager did not want to honor the price that was agree upon. When attempting to explain that we had confirmation numbers and a faxed verification we were told tough, the charge will be $50 extra per night. We were told a complaint number and that we would not be allowed to use the hotel telephone. After 30 minutes on the cell phone while standing on the sidewalk outside we were allowed to check in at our price. About an hour after settling into our room the manager called to get the complaint case number and called me a liar!!! Other staff were helpful and obviously embarassed. Beware of management!

<Content>Pleasant Stay in NOLA We came to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras Marathon on Feb. 24, and this was one of the closest hotels to the Start/Finish at the Superdome. We were a little concerned after seeing some of the reviews here, but decided to take the risk. We're very glad we did. The room was not palatial, but was certainly large enough for the two of us. It was clean, comfortable, and *quiet*. We were on the 10th floor of the hotel and had a view of the patio and pool, which is on the eighth floor. The National Guard is still helping police New Orleans at this time, and the Guardsmen are billeted at this hotel. We saw quite a few Guardsmen in the halls, elevators and lobby. Made us feel quite secure. One of the employees quipped that we were staying at the safest hotel in New Orleans. :-)The staff was cheerful and helpful. Most everyone has a Katrina story to tell. Their stories are amazing, inspirational, and heartbreaking. We asked if it was wise to walk from the hotel to the riverfront, and were told that its safe to walk around most anywhere downtown. We did a lot of walking between the hotel and the riverfront and didn't have any problems at all. This was my first ever trip to New Orleans, and I hope that I may someday get to go back. What a great place to visit! Everyone we met made us feel that they were glad we came.

<Content>People are marvelous! The people working at the Holiday Inn Superdome are among the finest hotel people I have ever encountered, travelling in all 50 states and Canada. They are very friendly and will do whatever it takes to make your stay great. I had booked a non-smoking room, but when I entered it, it reeked of stale smoke! I caught a maid servicing the room next door and she came over and gave a quick spritz of air freshner before I had to leave for a meeting. I then reported it to the front desk, who asked if I wanted moved. Since I had already unpacked, I did not, but Patrice and Brian at the front desk said they would take care of it and wash the walls. When I returned a few hours later, the room smelled fresh as a daisy! And it stayed that way the rest of my stay, so they didn't do just a quick fix. It appears they changed the bedspread, shampooed the carpets, as well as washed the walls to rid the room of the smoke.The shuttle drivers, Emmett and David, are just as nice and provide the only free shuttle service of any hotel in New Orleans. As a female travelling alone on this trip, they provided a valuable service so I could got out for the evening and not worry about feeling safe or having to wait for a cab.I feel Holiday Inn should have all their employees rotate thru this hotel to learn how to service their customers.

<Content>Not quite good First the Pros: Has shuttle to 6 close-in attractions that runs every hr. on the hr. by request. Staff was pleasant. Had an upgrade to concierge floor plus free parking when I booked the room through Travelocity. National Guard stays here through at least the end of summer, so you do feel safe in the midst of the still-recovering hotel surroundings. Hotel security guard is up on every person who walks in the door at night almost to the point of being too familiar/nosey while trying to be friendly!Cons: No gift/sundrie shop. Concierge floor offered no Club Room amenities, as advertised. Club Room in shambles, we discovered, when we tried to go for the canapes and cocktail service. Restaurant has limited selections and the staff is new and not experienced. Also, breakfast starts at 7 am, not 6:30 as advertised. Business center inop. as well as 8th floor swimming pool. Parking is $16.00 a day in their attached garage if you can't find a deal with res. on-line. Feel that the staff should have told us all of the the above when checking in to our pre-paid, nonrefundable room. Would not stay here again.

<Content>Stayed here for the NCAA's March 2007 Nice place to stay. We booked this due to the fact it is the closest operating Motel nearest to the Superdome-Arena. All in all a nice place to stay. The Restaurant was good, and the service was good also in the restaurant. The bar was also good, and the bloody mary's were spicy. While we were there the National Guard was staying there, so safety was NEVER a concern. We did alot of walking to the Arena, and to the French Qt. Saftey was not a concern there either. It was sad to see in the limited areas that we were in the destruction that was caused by Katrina, and like mentioned above we didnt wander far from those 2 areas. Downtown Business District and the French Qt.

<Content>Average hotel Stayed here for 2 nights in Dec 2006. Room on a concierge floor which I think means they are spacious? It was ok but nothing special. Clean tough and quite comfortable. Parking cost us $35 for 2 days!! Front desk staff were awful, very surly and unfriendly. Don't know whether it was because we were foreign visitors but they were so rude. Really wanted to get behind the desk and show them how to deal with customers properly. They have the Army staying here (200 of them) so it can be very busy and lots of comings and goings. Security officers man the hotel 24/7. Don't go out walking after dark unless you know the area. The bus driver was friendly and gave us some good tips. One of the security guards was also very helpful and gave us some good advise on trips to take etc.Not somewhere I would want to stay again but haven't got any complaints about my stay.

<Content>OK experience Stayed for a week following Katrina for business. The overall stay was average, nothing outstanding. Pros:-Large, spacious rooms. Especially on the top floors (concierge level, I think). I enjoyed the balcony overlooking City Hall and the ongoing work at the Superdome.-Access to I-10-Staff was pleasant to deal with.Cons:-The walk back from Bourbon Street at night (or even early evening) is a bit sketchy. There is about a 3-4 block area of DMZ.-The breakfast staff were understaffed when I was there, and the overall quality of food was ok. -Mold growth was observed in the room behind the vinyl wall covering. The wall covering was peeling off the wall and had been stapled in a futile attempt to keep it from falling.

<Content>Nice place to stay I stayed at this property for Mardi Gras from 2/27 through 3/1. We arrived at the hotel at noon and was told check-in time was a firm 3pm. The hotel was gracious in watching our bags while we went and had some lunch at Frankie  Johnny's. We arrivied back to the hotel at around 4:30pm. The check in was smooth. Room # 1129, which had a view of the front of the hotel(Loyoal Ave.). I must say I found the room to be bigger than what I had imagined and it was very clean. The next morning while showering, the water in the tub wasn't draining. I called the front desk and the immeiately sent up a maintenance person and the problem was fixed within a half hour. There is a bar in the hotel which stays open until 11pm. I was told from hotel staff that the flood waters were only within the lobby area but there were no signs of water damage anywhere.  This was my 8th trip to New Orleans and first since the flood. I expected to see a city in total disarray. What I saw was the complete opposite. There was no change in the quarter/downtown area. However the Mardi Gras crowd was a bit smaller than past celebrations. In my opinion many people were frightened away because of all the negative attention given by the media. There was a heavy police presence which made me feel much safer than my prior visits to New Orleans. The people of New Orleans were friendly as usual.

<Content>Average 3 star hotel Well, I stayed here my first time in New Orleans. I was there during a highschool music festival, and since about 10 of the highschools chose this hotel, there was literally 250 students with their instruments waiting for elevators when I first got there, and the lobby was SO small (the size of a Holiday Inn room) that I could barely fit inside the entrance of the hotel! The service was not at all personal, the workers could not even speak english. There Holiday Inn is a bit run down, don't be fooled by the pictures! There was some cute aspects to it...the jazzy theme and the restaurant were adorable, but I would definitely not stay here again. It's a good hotel if you are really on a budget and need a safe place to stay, but there are better places!! Location was very bad too...not at all within a walking distance of anything that New Orleans is famous for. To conclude...I was not impressed at all, but then again, I am used to the Ritz. (HI New Orleans doesn't even compare)

<Content>Horrible Experience I stayed at this hotel last weekend. To start off this hotel claims to be in the downtown area yet its a 10-12 block walk to the French Quarter and Bourbon St. They offer a shuttle bus every hour to and from the FQ until 10:30 PM. This means that you must end your evening at around 10:00 to catch the last bus. The breakfast buffet was a rip off. The bacon was swimming in a pool of liquid fat. They could of at least put some bread beneath the bacon to soak the fat. They charge an additional $2 for coffee and $3 for juice. I always stay at hotels that offer a breakfast buffet. Courtyard, Sheraton, and Ramada just a few. This was the fiirst time I was charged extra for the juice and coffee. I told the server I could accept the juice being an additional charge yet for you not to include the coffee with the $8.95 buffet charge is highway robbery. A party of five people overheard me and agreed. They mentioned thet they were billed $20 just for beverages. Guest services was terrible. I called downstairs to request 2 towels. After waiting 20 minutes I called again to confirm my request. After 30 minutes the towels finally arrived. This left me with just 10 minutes to get ready since I had a scheduled tour bus pick me up. On the positive note the attitude of the staff was friendly. The concierge Paul did all he can to answer my questions and request good restaurants. Overall due to hidden charges at breakfast, inexperienced guest services, and distant location I would not recommend this hotel. When visiting NO go to Cafe de Munde for some authentic beignets. Also if you like eating gator yet don't like it all breaded and fried go to Cafe Pontalba on St. Peters where you can have it sauted and blackened.

<Content>Would have stayed somewhere else if I could have This Holiday Inn was nothing spectacular. I stayed here in Jan. 2005, right before Mardi Gras, for a business meeting. I would have stayed somewhere else, had the meeting not been AT the Holiday Inn. The room I was originally in was somewhat comfortable, but I noted that the trash hadn't been emptied. The room was otherwise clean, but the continuous ambulance sirens (yes, they're located blocks from two major hospitals) made it somewhat difficult to sleep (and I was on the 16th floor). I was amazed when the staff asked me to switch rooms mid-stay so that they could shampoo the rugs before Mardi Gras. If they KNEW that I was staying for a week, why did they even put me in that room to begin with? Don't even bother with the restaurant on-site--what a ripoff! $13 for a horrible buffet. On the positive side, the free shuttle to the French Quarter and Riverwalk was great and I met some great people at the meeting. I wish I had stayed at the W or the Hilton and taken the free shuttle over to the HI for my meeting, however! Wouldn't stay at the Holiday Inn again.

<Content>What a gem! We stayed in the Holiday Inn Downtown Superdome the weekend of Dec. 29th through Jan. 1st and were simply amazed. I've paid much more for a hotel and haven't been as comfortable as the staff made me feel during my stay. We had a room on the 15th floor which had brand new carpet and updated furnishings in the lobby. The room we stayed in was exceptionally clean. Many of the reviews for this hotel, although rated high, described the hotel as being merely pleasant and I have to say that this is exactly how you feel while being there, extremely pleased. It is a tremendous bargain. They even had a continental breakfast and evening appetizers. The shuttle runs pretty much continuously throughout the day and will pick you up within minutes of calling them. My traveling companion became ill during our stay and the concierge arranged for someone to bring us hot chicken soup to our room (without being asked) because they didn't serve it in the restaurant. I will return to this hotel when in New Orleans!

<Content>Don't be fooled, this hotel sucks Well, I had several problems at The Holiday Inn Super Dome Downtown, the first of many was there ants in the bathroom, the carpet had several red stains on it, the sink stopper broke, the light in the bathroom blow out, some of linen appeared dirty, I tried to get on the internet and couldn't , the phone had alot of static in the line and repairman stated that was good. The hotel tried to overchange for telephone use , But they caught their mistake, Thank Goodness and last but least roomservice was poor and the food was awful. P.S. I stay have at one of the other Holiday Inn in New Orleans, and The Holiday Inn Super Dome Downtown is very poor in comparison.

It is only a few blocks from the French Quarter, but we usually took cabs or the free shuttle provided by the hotel, which is a great service. The breakfast buffet is a good deal, lots of fresh choices for only $8.

They were helpful, courteous, and interesting to talk to. One of the best I鈥檝e encountered anywhere. Rooms were clean and spacious, if a bit on the spare side. They could invest in better pillows. The 鈥渨orkout鈥?room only has aerobic machines, no weights, which is a problem when trying to stay fit in this food rich city.

<Content>WONDERFUL STAY! Arrived for Valentine's weekend. Got room off Orbitz. $119.00 for one night with the romance package that included a nice heart-shaped wicker basket with bath salts, chocolates and champagne and free breakfast for two the next morning. The staff was very friendly upon check-in and also upgraded our room to a kingsize bed because Orbitz only had a double bed when we booked. Our room was very clean and the bathroom was emaculate! The only inconvience we incurred was when housekeeping knocked on our door at 8:58 AM calling HOUSEKEEPING! I told them we were still asleep. They apologized. I later called and asked for a late check-out, which they granted us one hour. We didn't get to use our breakfast coupons, however the front desk encouraged us to go ahead and use them although it was after noon! Parking is $15 which is good compared to some others. The walking distance to the Quarter isn't bad at all. They also have a shuttle, but because we were there during Mardi Gras, the shuttle was not operating.

<Content>Friendliest Staff/great amenities Friendly doesnt even begin to decribe just how nice everyone from the front desk to the maintenance people were. Anything we wanted, all we had to do was mention it once. Everyone called us by name. Turn down service everynight, including mints on our pillows! Fresh coffee and breakfast in the morning and hors d'ouvres every evening. We are Priority Club members, which is free by the way, which made these services available. We did not stay in top of the line rooms and did not pay top prices and we were still treated like we had. Well kept and clean. We dont like stuffy hotels but do enjoy the amenities of them. In this hotel we had the comfort of Holiday Inn with the amenities of upscale hotels. The shuttle service to local attractions was fabulous and they were there to pick us up whenever we called for a ride back to our hotel. overall if you want a fun relaxed vacation in New Orleans with a feel of being cared for this is the place to go. everyone was so friendly! (and we felt that way BEFORE we drank the hurricanes too!) Thanks Holiday Inn!

<Content>I thoroughly recommend it I booked our room after reading very good reviews of this hotel on tripadvisor and travelocity. It's a short and pleasant walk to the French Quarter, the pool is delightful, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the concierge was, well, Rick. He's the man. He'll set you up right. Told us where to go listen to gospel and where to find beer for in room use. Note there are two hospitals in close proximity, so sirens will be heard. The restaurant was only ok, but it's there if you need it. The catch of the day was quite good, baked catfish, but everthing else was pretty uninspired and mundane. Still, it was a great value, and we were there for 7 days and we were very happy with the choice.

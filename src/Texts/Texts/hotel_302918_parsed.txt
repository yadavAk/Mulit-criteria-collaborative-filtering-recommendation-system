<Content>Only for business men When I go to Beijing, our local office always books me a room in this hotel since it is very close to the office. It's the only good point for this hotel. All the rest is terrible : there is a strange smell in all the hotel (including rooms), food is way bellow average (and I love chinese cuisine), cleaningness could be improved, most of TV channels are in chinese...I would not recommend this hotel to tourist but I have to admit that it's central location and the view (if you are on the top floors) are intresting.

<Content>Good Hotel, Good Location A good hotel. We would stay here next time.Pros- Good central location- 5-10 min walk to metro- 15 mins walk to large mall with large food court (20-23 RMB per meal) and restaurants on bottom level, and Wangfujing Street Night Market (scorpions and sea-horses on kebab sticks)- Breakfast in revolving restaurant on 28th floor (ours was included in room rate, as we booked through a Chinese agency)- Good sized rooms with view, shower + bath- Good English spoken by staff, and very helpfulCons- Day Tours to wall a bit pricey, and include very unnecessary stops to silk market or Chinese medicine building- No seating in lobby area- Corridors consistently had a musty, pot-noodle smell. - Western food at breakfast is not the best (franch toast as they call it, was terrible) - stick to Chinese food / freshly cooked on demand eggs and omelets instead. As expected, this is a 5 star Chinese hotel (very good 4 star Western rated hotel). If you want a true 5 star, you should book a Western chain such as the Hyatt.

<Content>Fantastic Me and my family went to Beijing in 2003 as part of family vacation and it has been the greatest experience/vacation ever!Aside from the fact that China is really beautiful and it is very different from China Town and Chinese food we see in North America, the hotel itself was a pure LUXURY. We all enjoyed staying at this beautiful, luxury hotel. Stuff were very nice, friendly and bilingual. Location was good but not very close to major tourist destinations ( we booked city tour and had an amazing tour guide so for us did not really matter). Restaurants in the hotel are pricey but again very high class and they are many pianist playing while you are eating.

<Content>Very nice hotel A group of us stayed here as a launching off point for a longer trip in China. I stayed two nights and found it to be quite comfortable and quiet. The beds have very luxurious linens and slept like a rock. I didn鈥檛 watch TV, but I used the in-room internet (at a reasonable cost). I loved the robe and slippers and the nice hot shower. The bathroom was clean though the marble counter top was stained (some people might think that looks unclean, but it was not dirty). I lacked for nothing. I used the gym, which was a little on the small side, but apparently the hotel is upgrading their fitness facilities which will be ready by December 2008. In the meantime, this space was fine and I鈥檇 come here again.

<Content>Quite a surprise! We stayed at the Beijing International Hotel in November 2007 as part of a trade group that was traveling China. Beijing was our first destination.Check in was handled by our group's chinese hosts. To cash traveler's checks or change money, you must got to the cashier and bring your passport.This is a surprisingly large hotel. We stayed on an upper floor with an excellent view of the city, and overlooked the train station. The amenities were consistent with a western 3-star hotel. In China, hotels are rated from 1 to 7 stars. So, adjust expectations accordingly.When we entered the room, we experienced confusion on how to turn on the lights. It turns out that your room key slides into an illuminated slot by the lights. Once your key has been inserted, you can turn on the lights and the heat or air conditioning. Once the key has been removed, these services are disabled. There is one english language channel, which is a news broadcast. You can arrange wake up calls very easily through the telephone without having to speak to the front desk. We had two beds, approximately American full in size. These were the most comfortable beds I found in China. Linens and blankets were in very good shape as was the room. The bathroom was somewhat dated with respect to the fixtures. Everything worked and the shower stayed hot. The hotel has excellent security. We did receive one call the first night asking if we wanted massage. We had been warned that this is pretty common in China. Housekeeping was certainly adequate, on par with most American hotels and quite a bit cleaner than many. The hotel restaurant offers a very good western breakfast as well as asian foods. You need your room key with the key jacket showing your dates of stay to be seated, but it's self service. We had no complaints about the quantity of the food and it was fun to try some of the chinese foods as well. Service was good, but slow at times to refill the coffee. The hotel's location is quite good and is adjacent to several banks and across the street from a Starbucks (called fourbucks by the Chinese). There's a shopping center in walking distance along with several american fast food restaurants. There's more than adequate room for tour group buses to pull up outside the hotel. The property is not located on the same side of the city as the Olympic venues. It's rather closer to Tien An Men Square and the Forbidden City, but those are still approximately a twenty minute drive, and about an hour from Beijing International Airport.Check out was equally easy. All major credit cards are accepted.

<Content>Very decent I agree with other reviewers who said that 5 stars in China is not the same as 5 stars in the U.S., but still, this is a decent business hotel that is well-located. The room was very nice and we especially appreciated the good quality bed and linens. Breakfast we thought was amazing--quite the international variety of food, from American (sort of) to Japanese and beyond. You can definitely find something to suit your diet. Try the warm soy milk; I thought it was delicious. On the down side, the huge reddish granite lobby had not a single chair anywhere, which seemed very odd considering that tour groups meet there every day, and also the first room we got was definitely a smoking room even though the tour operator had requested and confirmed a non-smoking reservation. There were ashtrays in the room and it smelled of smoke. However, the staff apologized and moved us promptly to another room which was fine. Also, FYI, we noticed both of those problems (lack of lobby chairs and erratic definition of non-smoking) in more than one 5-star hotel in China. My new tongue-in-cheek theory is that in China, a non-smoking room means nobody is smoking in there right now. I am not sure it is right to blame any one specific hotel for what appears to be an endemic problem in the Chinese hospitality industry. I would be willing to stay here again but I might trade up if my budget allowed.

<Content>Good location - dirty bathroom Supposed to be a five star hotel, however this was not exactly what I would call 5 stars.Pros:-great location - convenient for walking places - tianamen, restaurants etc-safe-internet-nice building interiors, food, spa-courteous staff-decent priceCons:-dirty bathroom - moldy, water didn't drain in shower-smelly hallways - my entire hallway smelled of mold and cigarette smoke even though it was supposed to be a smoke free hallOverall: I'd stay here since this seemed to be a common theme for higher end hotels in China. I'd look for newer hotels first, but could stay here again based on price. I was in one of the higher floors so I think I was in one of the executive rooms based on our group negotiation

<Content>Definitely no 5 star. We stayed at this hotel for 4 days.The room we stayed in was in pretty good shape but the bathroom was awful, the bathtub was worn out and the tiles on the floor showed some cracks.The airconditioning was not working so we had to sleep with the windows open for three nights. The location and food were okay especially the breakfast buffet.

<Content>Loved the Beijing International Hotel My wife and I spent 8 nights in the BIH and we loved every minute of it. It's a world class hotel with outstanding service, courteous and helpful staff, and quiet, beautifully appointed rooms. The bathroom was tastefully done in black marble, crhome fixtures and clear glass. The bed was one of the best we've ever slept on. There was even a pillow menu where you could select from different kinds of pillows to suit your taste. I don't know enough superlatives to describe the hotel. Spacious, elegant, with several outstanding restaurants. Opposite a shopping center with a McDonald's if you get tired of Chinese cuisine. Near a subway line, close to all the major attractions. The staff waited on us hand and foot and would not even allow us to pour our own wine at dinner. Very highly recommended. Excellent value for money.

<Content>tour warning The tours that are available through the hotel all stop at 'silk factories'. This fact is NOT disclosed upon booking. The only purpose of these 'factory tours' is to get gullible foreigners to buy stuff. We can only imagine the level of kickback to the tour operator and the hotel.When booking a tour to the Great Wall for example... one expects to ONLY get a tour of the Great Wall, not a shopping expedition. They should offer 'silk factory tours' as a separate offering.We didn't like being snookered.

<Content>You're in China We booked our stay through a tour company in April of 2007. Realize that China's 5 stars are not the same as US 5 stars. The hotel however was generally excellent. The rooms had a view depending on which side of the hotel you were on. The staff was accomdating and always seemed ready to help. Generally we ate only breakfast at the hotel and it was excellent and the variety was extensive. The coffee was also much better than I expected and close to American coffee. The rooms could use a little updating but ours was clean and comfortable. The location of the hotel is excellent being within walking distance of major shopping areas as well as some historic sights. A little advice though, take a cab. The hotel staff will help you with a card directing the cab drivers where you wish to go. Not many cab drivers in China speak English which by the way, was not a problem with the hotel staff. While I had no preconceived notions about the hotel, it definitely was a pleasant stay and I would stay here again with no hesitation.

<Content>Good, Not Great We stayed 5 nights at the Beijing International Hotel as part of the Great Wall Marathon travel package. The hotel rooms are a little worn but acceptable. Rooms were clean and of fairly good size. The included breakfasts (international buffet) were of fair quality. For those looking to use the airport shuttle bus, there is a stop right at the hotel - only 16RMB to the airport. I'd say in it's heydey, this hotel may have been considered 5 star, but now it's more of a value option.

<Content>Acceptable business hotel I stayed on an executive floor for 3 nights. Contrary to others, I found the hotel very good.My room whilst not massive, was acceptable in size, very clean and everything bar the air conditioning worked. The executive floors provide free broadband internet and that worked well, apart from censoring the BBC.Tea and coffee were always available in the executive lounge.Staff at reception were always pleasant and responsive.Prostitutes seem to be a plague in Beijing. I didn't get the cards under my room door, but they were hanging around the main entrance.

<Content>OK but not 5 star I had been told this was a 5 star hotel and while the lobby area was very nice the floor I was on wasn't. As soon as I left the elevator there was a burnt rubber smell and the room, while spacious had dirty carpet. The bathroom had some mould on the door and tiles. The staff were very good but I would rate this hotel at 3.5 stars at best.

<Content>Central - and handy! The hotel was not as good (even though it is 5 star too) as the one we stayed at - at Chengdu.However in saying that - it was still a good stay.There were prostitute business cards put under our door during the night - but you just had to have a laugh really at the translations. Despite what other reviews say - we didn't see any lolling around our corridors at night?The money exchange counter we had no problems with either. We went and exchanged a lot of 100 yuans for smaller notes - and the lady was more than helpful.The food was really nice - and the revolving restaurant up the top was quite the novelty.It is about a 25 minute walk to the Silk Market - and we paid 10 yuan for a taxi back to the hotel.McDonalds over the street if you feel so inclined - but there are so many lovely types of cuisine over there I wouldn't be bothered.T :-)

<Content>Nice Standard hotel Located across from shopping mall, One block from main train station and about 4 blocks from major pedestrian only shopping area. McDonald's across the street. Several ATMs across the street. Lobby is nice, large, business center where you can use internet for a fee (10 minutes for 20 Yuans). Money can change in lobby. Concierge in lobby, very poor English and not useful. Written cards available at Concierge written in Chinese to show to Taxi driver. Cheap Taxis. Cost only 11 Yuan to Silk Market (7.6 Yuan to one US $)Rooms are decent but not fancy. Room thermostat is hard to control or not easily understandable. Room safe. No iron or ironing board (true for all Chinese hotels). Watch out for laundering...cost High.

<Content>Mold problem Stayed here as part of tour group. The shower (although renovated) had a very serious mold (or dead aminal) issue and smelled so bad we had to open window and leave open the entire time. I think they just placed marble like material over already existing fixture. The water pressure was very low and the towels were very tiny and old. They smelled like mold too, but maybe that was just because they were in bathroom. The constant business cards left under the door by the hookers and massage for gentleman ladies that were wandering the halls all night got a bit old, especially since I had my 13 year old son with me. One person in our group even had one of these women, which you could see on every floor just sitting on the sofa near the elevators) knock on their door after hours to see if they wanted any services. The breakfast buffet is good but the staff could care less that you are there, are downright rude, and claim they speak no English. The front desk messed up our reservation (giving my mother and son) a king bed instead of double and took a lot of arguing betwen our tour guide and the front desk to fix. The front desk clerk then went on make several nasty remarks in Chinese about the Americans. The currency exchange desk lady was very rude ans extremely slow. She refused to take any currency if it even looked like it had been plced in your billfold or folded in half (only extremely crisp new money could be exchanged.) Hotel had no ATM (money machine/teller) which was very inconvenient for international hotel. Internet was fast but cost $20 US for the day.  The worst is when we checked out they accused just about everyone in the tour group of stealing their towels, including us, which was funny because we did not even use the bathroom, including the towels, the last day due to the then unbearable smell. There are too many hotels, most in better locations and even across the street to waste time or money on this one. However, if you are forced to stay here, across the street (use the underpass located to the right of the hotel) and you come to McDonalds and a cheap grocery store for water, soda, ect.

<Content>Overcharge $++++ Great hotel, great room, amenities such as as gym and pool were under construction despite calling ahead to verify construction was completed. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE!Charged me for 3 meals at breakfast two days in a row when I never had breakfast!!! Then pretended no longer to speak english when the same girl checked me in with great english language skills.Late check in at 10pm, hotel claimed they gave my room away and no longer any vacancy at the same price point. Would not give me a room upgrade at the same price despite giving my room away!!!Salon gave me a horrible hair cut (no surprise) then attempted to double charge!!!Almost late for my flight because check out took close to an hour. No exageration, close to an hour!!!Go somewhere else when in Beijing.

<Content>OK-not as nice as other luxury hotels In true luxury fashion, the lobby and mall areas are exquisite, but the actual rooms are a step above Super 8 (USA) standards. It is clear that this hotel was one of the first luxury hotels in Beijing, and the location is incredible. As you walk through the lobby you may run into government officials from any continent or travellers from any region. The lounge/bar area is pretty neat with indoor patio style configuration with trees and fountains.The negatives: Unless you are willing to get the super-suite, they will put you in a sub-par room. Hope you packed an iron....to get you suits pressed is a pretty good fee as they mysterously have no irons in the rooms. There is no door hangar to keep housekeeping out (also mysteriously missing) so your guarenteed to have someone in your room everyday (something to consider if you are on official business). Beds are ancient but useable (I've seen worse). I guess one needs to remember that you are in China and not set your lodging expectations too high. On my most recent business trip I stayed in much better new-western hotels, but had limited tradeoffs in location and price....Welcome to China!Overall it is grand for show, but for actual lodging it is well below the Marriot/Sheratons of the world. I guess the location offsets the financial burden of staying in a average room.

<Content>Surprised by the great standard We have just returned to Australia from 7 nights spent at the Beijing International. As it was part of an organised tour and completely pre-paid, we had no idea what to expect. Having stayed in other Asian cities we thought it would be convenient and clean at best, cramped and with limited facilities at worst. We were very pleasantly surprised - Yes, it was convenient and clean, but it was also spacious and had great facilities. The service was efficient and polite, language only a minor barrier, most staff speaking quite good English. Bedding was comfortable, bathrooms clean and adequate with all the shampoo,etc you might need. Hairdryer also. Bottled water was supplied daily as the tap water is undrinkable. Also supplied was tea, coffee and whitener, as well as a kettle so that you can have that all important cuppa at the start and end of the day! The restaurants were good, coffee overpriced as it is all over BeiJing. Breakfast buffet includes all anyone could ever desire, no matter what part of the world you're from. We would definitely reccommend this hotel and will definitely stay again.

<Content>Hotel  Stayed at this hotel as part of tour package. It's rated 5 star, but it isn't as nice as a true 5 star in Western countries. I probably wouldn't stay here if I had to pay for the room (cheapest I found was US $130 for Nov).The location is great - 1 block from the main train station and subway. The airport shuttle also departs from the hotel parking lot. Looking at a map of Beijing, it seems like this hotel is only a couple of streets from the attractions. However, be aware that city blocks are long, so walking 2-3 blocks can take a while. However, taxi is very cheap (typical fare is less than US $2).Our room was a standard with 2 twin beds. The linen and towels were fresh. The temp in our room was very hot. There seemed to be too much central heating as we had our thermostat turned off. We had to cool the room down by opening the windows, but it was difficult to control how wide the window gap we want. One more thing I didn't like was that the room was very dark even with all the lights turned on.There is a small refrigerator in the room. You get 2 small bottles of water for free, and there is a water kettle for boiling water before drinking.I think this is a decent hotel if not for the high price. There are a lot of other hotels that are cheaper and just as nice.

<Content>Nice hotel The hotel was nice the lobby was pretty grand looking and everything was very clean. We booked through a travel agency with a full package deal so I don't know exactly how much we paid but we were happy with it. Like most hotels we found in china the standard room has 2 twin beds so if you want something else I would coordinate that before hand. They are not bolted to the wall so we just pushed them together. The breakfast buffet was great and was included in our package it had everything from cereal and bacon and eggs to all sorts of chinese breakfast type items. Overall we were pleased the bathroom was great with all the shampoo, combs, lotion etc.. that you could want and the beds although kind of hard offered great bedding. All in all not a bad place there is a Starbucks right across the street and if you need to stop at a shop and get some snacks there is one by the train station about a block away (w/i walking distance). We felt very safe walking even at night

<Content>Very nice, upscale hotel Just returned from a four night stay at the Beijing International Hotel. It was the hotel our tour company booked and it was evident that a lot of tour companies use this hotel. It is the kind of hotel I probably wouldn't of stayed at if it wasn't booked through the tour company, mostly due to price than anything else (a moderate room books at $220 US per night). The staff are friendly, the rooms are immaculate and the breakfast that was included with our room was very good, with a mixture of Chinese and Western cuisine. They have a business centre (20 RMB for 10 minutes on the internet), fitness centre, and spa (massage was wonderful). The hotel shops on the second floor were very expensive but the supermarket on the lobby level for pop, snacks, etc. was reasonable. Within walking distance to Forbidden City and a 16 RMB cab ride to the Pearl Market. A great place to stay if you have the $ and like a more upscale hotel. Only complaint would be that the front desk staff have limited English, which made check-in and check-out somewhat frustrating.

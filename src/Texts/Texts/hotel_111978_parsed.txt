<Content>Charming hotel with character We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Villa Convento during our January honeymoon. Like others have said, it's a small family-run hotel, so you shouldn't expect it to be as fancy as the Ritz, the Omni, or the Windsor Court. But Hotel Villa Convento offers excellent value for its price, has so much character, and is so typically New Orleans. Our second-floor room was small but cozy, and we loved having wine on our balcony. The staff was welcoming and helpful in recommending their favorite restaurants. And the location, down a quieter side street in the French Quarter, was fantastic! We look forward to staying here again.

<Content>Loved it I stayed at the Villa Convento with a friend for three nights, and we couldn't have been happier there. Our balcony room was small, but nice, and it was very clean. I'm amazed by the complaints from other guests. If you're looking for the Four Seasons, go there. This is a small, family-run hotel with more charm than all the four star hotels in NOLA combined. AND, unlike 99% of the hotels in New Orleans, this one offers free garage parking. It's a few blocks away, and you have to get (and return) a key in order to access it, but it's not a big hassle. It gave us great peace of mind to know the car was safe. We also loved the location, just a couple of blocks away from the French Market and right in the heart of the French Quarter. We walked everywhere. This place is safe, quiet, and more reasonably priced than most other places we considered staying. I'll definitely go back.

<Content>my favorite spot My husband and i have stayed at the Hotel Villa Convento every spring since 1983, always in March and often returning in April.I make my reservations a year in advance to be sure of getting in.I have watched the Campo family develop and maintain this charming place through a number of struggles, not the least of which was Katrina. They fight a constant battle against problems common to New Orleans, including the humidity and the post-Katrina lack of help . I have never felt unsafe there.It may ot be your 'cup of tea' if the Hilton is more your style. I like the personal touch the Campos put on the place. I find it very comfortable, and I know I'm welcome there. As the years have progressed, so has my disabling arthritis, and the hotel has made it easy for me to cope, constructing a ramp so my scooter can be stored in the laundry room.I look forward to returning for many years to come.

<Content>Mice, Mold, No Heat, Lots of Smoking! We chose the Villa Convento for it's location (walking distance to attractions, but far enough away to be on a quiet street). We were first time visitors. New Orleans was just rated with one of the highest crime rates in the USA, yet the Villa Convento is wide open to anyone who walks in off the street. The front door is open, and desk clerk is usually in the back, so anyone can wander in. Rooms have mold and mouse/rat infestation, throughout the entire property. Maids do not come in everyday, so you have to take your own trash out. They falsely advertise a free continental breakfast (rolls and pastery), but all they give you is free coffee or tea in the lobby. There were days when we didn't even get coffee: Were told they were out of coffee because the owner forgot to buy it. There was building debris of some kind piled up by a wall in the hall when we arrived, and days later, it was still there. There was no heat in our room, unless we used the space heater, which was a fire hazard. The place was a badly organized, badly maintained, filthy mess, had no heat, an elevator at the end of the hall that woke us up with banging and groaning every time it was in use. And with all that lack of service, lack of security, lack of cleanliness, and presence of toxic mold, aswell as rats and mice, they have the nerve to say No Pets and No Smoking in guest rooms? Are they KIDDING?! Smoking is the only way one can block out the stink of the ratty old sticky wall to wall carpeting, and moldy walls! With all the rodents they have at the Villa Convento, I would imagine they would welcome people who want to bring their pet snakes for a free meal! If you MUST stay there, be sure to look inside your luggage when you are packing to leave, and be sure you are not taking any rodents home with you by accident. They tend to nestle into warm places, like packed suitcases, because the rooms are so freezing cold.If this hotel was in Washington, it would probably be closed down by the Health Department.

<Content>Disabled Guest I have read all of the reviews. Those that mentioned the elevator should have added the fact that the Vacuum Cleaner was stored in the elevator. I think that we got a good deal. My only regret is that we didn't get one of the 2 floor rooms. I would have loved to have seen the hotel in better days, but, that didn't happen. The owner;s daughters were really nice. The would make their dad proud of them if he was watching!

<Content>Not great at the Hotel Villa Convento It was quiet, but the interior is rough around the edges, and they did not have maid service and room trash removal daily. Over all, the property could use a paint job, new carpets, and we had rodent infestation in our top floor room. They advertised free continental breakfast, but when we were there, they only served coffee and tea, and instructed us to buy our own rolls from the bakery across the street. They lock the door late at night, but the security is otherwise lax, because when the front door is open, there is often no one at the front desk, and there is no security guard, so anyone can walk in and have access to hallways and rooms. The location is good, because it is very quiet, but close to the restaurants and attractions. But this hotel needs work.

<Content>Not horrible. My husband and I stayed at the Villa Convento for 2 nights in April 2007. The location of this place is right in the middle of the French Quarter, within walking distance to basically everything. This hotel has no private parking, and there is a 10 minute parking spot for people to unload their luggage. We were unfortunate enough not to be able to park in the 10 minute loading zone due to several people being parked there for an extended time. This made unloading and loading the car difficult since it is a one-way street and people would not wait for us to get our luggage (lots of honking and ugly looks). Other than the parking problem (which is quite common in the French Quarter), check-in and check-out was a breeze. The staff was very friendly and helfpul. There is a parking garage located about 4 or 5 blocks away (hotel staff will direct you to it), and the walk is easy as long as you don't have luggage with you.Our room was number 207. It wasn't very big, but who plans to stay in their hotel room while in New Orleans? The room itself was clean, but had a funny odor to it. The ceiling had some major stains, but overall things were fine. Bourbon Street is 2 blocks away, as well as the French Market. There are plenty of places to eat in the area, and shopping is good as well (I would suggest Royal Street). New Orleans is a changed place of course, and could really use a face-life (as well as this hotel). I spoke with other tourists during our stay, and they all agreed that most hotels in the area (even the very expensive ones) need a major overhauling these days.Things at the Villa Convento were going smoothly until it was time for us to pack up our luggage and check out. Then, I spotted it. The biggest cockroach I've ever seen! We are talking 3 inches long! It was crawling up the brick wall in our room! There was another one under the night stand as well that peeked its head out at about the same time. I guess they waited for us to pack up to say goodbye. I realize that N.O. has survived a major catastrophe, so the bug problem is to be expected. It just took me off guard I guess. Needless to say, this is the last impression of our stay at the Villa Convento. The overall stay was fine, but watch out for giant bugs!!

<Content>Mixed Bag We stayed at the Villa Convento for a week in March 2007 and like many of the previous reviewers, found problems at this hotel. The staff is very friendly, the location is great, but quite frankly, the hotel was not very clean. The entry way is very run down and the carpets don't look like they have been cleaned in years. Plaster is falling off of the walls, the chairs in the entry are threadbare, and there are water stains on the ceiling and walls. Some of the problems can be attributed to Katrina, but many can not. The carpets were not vacumed the entire time we were there, with the same pieces of lint and small debris never removed. A close look at our room revealed dust that had turned into dirt on the top of shelves, picture frames and electrical cords. The bathroom walls had splatter spots that could have been easily washed off, along with simple things like washing light switches overlooked. Also, while the location of the hotel in the lower French Quarter is very quiet, we could clearly hear the conversations and TV from the room next to us. One day, when we returned from our activities, the room had not been cleaned and when I mentioned to the management that the maid had missed our room, was told that we wouldn't have maid service the next day either because the maid had gone to Houston! I think some of the staffing problems can be attributed to the shortage of labor because of Katrina, but, in general, I got the impression that the owners were just letting the place get rundown out of apathy or because they know people will continue to book there because of the location. The furniture on the balcony was rusted and broke when I was sitting on it, the plants shown in the pictures of the hotel are gone and the advertized continental breakfast is no more. I would warn anyone who makes a reservation here not to expect too much.

<Content>Still my favorite My husband and I have stayed at the Villa Convento many times over the past 20 years. This was our first visit since Katrina and I was happy to see not too much has changed. The Campo family has a jewel in the French Quarter and I thank them for that. We even got lucky enough to go grab coffee and croussiants and have them on our balcony in February (a treat to be outside this time of year when you are from Michigan). Things in NO on a whole seemed a little quiet, but if the tourists get back, I believe it will be ok. We will go back again and again, and my first choice will be to stay at the Villa Convento.

<Content>Friendly and Comfortable. I really liked this hotel. This is not the fanciest of hotels (a previous reviewers shabby chic comment certainly applies). But, it is one I would stay at again without hesitation. The location is great (close to Decatur and the French Market). It was cozy (esp. considering the weather was cold while I was there), clean, and comfortable. My room was large and nicely furnished. The owners were very helpful, especially with dining recommendations. Every place they recommended was good. Nice job Hotel Villa Convento!

<Content>I love the VIlla I have stayed at the Villa the past 3 out of 4 Jazz Fest's. The one time I stayed somewhere else I missed it terribly. It is a wonderful hotel, with lots of history and character. This family run establishment is helpful with guest concerns and willing to fo above and beyond. The crouissants are to die for as well. The courtyard breakfast with a cup of really good coffee is a great way to start your day after a night of music before. I will always stay at the Villa when I am in NOLA from now on.

<Content>Great Place To Stay! Even Greater Location! Just got back from NO tonight. The Villa Convento is a great place to stay. My wife and I were there June 7, 2006-June 11, 2006. We were on the second floor with a balcony overlooking Ursulines. Very relaxing to sit on the balcony, smoke a cigar and watch the people go by. The front desk people are very friendly and helpful. The room was nice,clean, a little small, but ample room for 2. The AC worked great!Thankfully, as it was around 100 with the heat index a couple of days. The location was awesome as we were within just a few blocks of most everthing we wanted to do. I would recommend this hotel as a great stay at a great price in a great location in a great town. Can't wait to return!

<Content>Great Feel of the French Quarter My wife had to go to a conference last May in New Orleans for two days. We decided to make a long weekend out of it so I flew down after. She had stayed at the Astor, then checked out and we met at the Villa Convento for 3 nights. I have to admit that I loved it. it was suggested to us by a friend. I think that if you go to the French Quarter and want the whole experience then staying in a chain hotel is a waste. You can stay at a chain in any town in America. Hotels such as the Villa give you the perfect ambiance and feel of the quarter. The building has a lot of history. Our room was clean, there were areas where they could stand to repair but we felt it was cozy and a fun place to stay. We stayed in Room 300 which was a full bed with a balcony view looking over Ursulines Street. The street is very quiet and a quick walk to Bourbon. PLUS right across the street is Croissant d'Ors. This has to be the best bakery and coffee shop in the quarter. You can run across the quiet street, grab breakfast to go and be on your private iron balcony within 5 minutes. We are coming back again in late May  early June for 5 days and staying here again, this time in room 302 which is a queen bed. On the 3rd floor, rooms 300-302 are all balcony rooms with a view of the street and the convent.They have a pretty good website that shows you photos and room layouts of all their rooms. Check it out and check in if you are looking for an authentic New Orleans experience.

<Content>Hotel Villa Convento has Potential. For the price in the French Quarter in New Orleans, you can't beat Hotel Villa Convento. However be advised that there are problems with the hotel: the hotel in general (lobby, courtyard, stairwell,...) is very run down. Our room seemed to be charming BUT we were very dismayed to find bed bugs laying on our bed all 4 nights of our stay there. Good points: FRIENDLY staff, location (safe neighborhood), bathroom was newly renovated. All in all, if you have a family, spend the extra money to stay at a nice hotel. All others...be aware what I detailed above.

<Content>Great staff, dirty hotel I went here near Christmas. Before I discuss the hotel I would like to tell a little but about me. I go to the quarter often. I have stayed at half of the hotels in the quarter. They have a charm all their own. Most of them are not in the best condition but are beautiful because of the history and architecture they contain. I will stay at any one these before I would stay at a big soulless chain. The Villa Convento has a wonderful location. It is next to the best pastry shop I have ever eaten at. The chocolate croissant is unbelievable. I make sure I eat at the Croissant D鈥檕r every morning while I am in New Orleans. The French Market can be seen from the hotel. The location is also very quiet. The parking makes you feel like you car is very safe. The staff is sweet and blithely delightful. Now the hotel itself leaves some to be desired. The room was dirty. Not a little dirty, filthy. The bathroom had a dirty hand towel on the floor, toothpaste and spit on the mirror. The hotel was short-handed due to the hurricane but should still be cleaned between guests. A mold was growing on the ceiling line of the room. The brick walls always stayed damp causing this problem. Every time you touch the wall you would get a brick power on your clothing. When you have a wall of this age one should seal it. This would get rid of the mold and the brick dust. The bed was against the wall. So, when you would sleep brick dust would get into your eyes and face. Again, if the walls were sealed this would not be a problem. If this hotel does some renovations I would go back.

<Content>hotel villa convento has charm My husband and stayed at the Villa Convento in October, 2005, shortly after New Orleans was reopened to visitors. We have stayed at the Villa Convento several times and I will agree that it is somewhat run-down and needs sprucing up. However, we have always found the staff to be very accommodating, in fact, it is the friendliness of the staff that makes us return. On two different occasions, we have had staff members visit with us for over an hour, just being sociable. When we visited shortly after Katrina, we found everything to be in order as much as possible under the circumstances. Our bathroom was spotlessly clean (always has been every time we have stayed there). The room was clean enough - by that I mean that our bedding was clean and the carpet was clean. If you looked in the corners you would probably see some dust. However, we had a wonderful balcony so I wasn't going to complain about a little bit of dust in the corners. Two years ago my husband and I arrived in the French Quarter on Halloween Day, a very busy day for the Quarter. We were having a terrible time trying to get a room. We stopped at Villa Convento and they did not have any rooms in their hotel, but they also manage a property across the street, and they had a room available for $39! That price would make me suspicious anywhere, and unheard of in the Quarter. We asked to see the room first, and found it to be a very clean, nice room. In fact, the bathroom fixtures appeared to be brand new. That $39 room in the French Quarter was probably the best travel bargain that we ever got - and in addition to that, we also got to spend an hour or so chatting with the delightful Ms. Campo, who is in her 80's, but prior to Katrina continued to work at the Villa Convento.The Villa Convento is a quaint family-owned and operated guesthouse. It is not a 5 star hotel.

<Content>if you like long term dirt and grim, you will love this This property has great potential but unfortunately the grim is overwhelming. My family thinks the dirt, dust and krud build up has been there so long that they don't see it any longer. It is a shame. Perfectly located, the hotel desperately needs some TLC. The courtyard is shabby, dark, with dead plants everywhere. The hallway carpeting has not been cleaned nor vacumed for what looks like months. They blame the house keeping staff but as owners one would think they would have a bit more pride in their property. They get their money up front so you don't have much choice in staying. We felt they received their $1,000 for the week's lodging and their obligation stopped there. It is the first time ever in all our years of traveling that we was made to feel defensive when we asked to have our rooms cleaned over. This is a perfect example of a hotel brochure that is slick, but the only thing that is slick is the bathroom floor. As a guest, if you keep your eyes straight forward and don't touch anything, you will be fine.

<Content>Absolutely Charming I stayed at the Villa Convento in Dec 2005, after the Deluge. Eventhough I was expecting some inconveniences due to the condition of the rest of New Orleans, at the Villa Convento all was well and good. The service at the front desk was exemplary - friendly and professional. The room was charmingly shabby chic, but clean and cozy. I slept very well in the comfortable bed and quiet room. I would stay there again in a heart beat - except for the parking. The parking fee is very reasonable because the parking garage is a few blocks away from the hotel. I was alone and had difficulty in finding a place to park whenever I had to get or return the parking garage key. If I had been with another person who could jump out and do the key thing while I waited in the car, it wouldn't have been a problem. I felt reasonably safe walking to and from the garage, but it wasn't the ideal situation for a female walking alone. Otherwise, the Villa Convento was a highlight of my stay in New Orleans, and I recommend it as an excellent value.

<Content>Will return again and again We have stayed at the Hotel Villa Convento a number of times in the last 10+ years. The rooms are always clean, the staff is always friendly (and they remember us, even when we phone for reservations), and the hotel is always quiet at all hours. The furnishings, linens and bathrooms have improved over the years. And the price is definitely right, and for us the location is perfect--not too near the noisy areas, but close enough to quickly walk to any of our favorite shops, bars and restaurants--and the pastry shop across the street is heaven. Although the elevator does need work and the courtyard could be improved, we love the place, and will never stay anywhere else in N.O. if we have a choice. Best of luck to the Campo family during their recovery from the Hurrican Katrina disaster.

<Content>just ok, too pricey for condition Stayed recently but felt that the price we paid, just over $100 a night (plus tax) was too expensive for the condition of the room. As a result I would not stay there again. I felt that we could have paid a little more and stayed in a much, much nicer hotel. The location is ideal but there are tons of Hotels in the French Quarter so next time we would rather pay a little more for a much nicer stay. Although you are not in your rooms alot we expected a little more for +100 a night. Yes the hotel has character but our room could use a remodel. Two of the three windows didn't open, a towel rack was falling off wall, water pressure low, slow bathtub drain, etc. We did enjoy our stay, don't get me wrong, but we would have felt better paying in the 80's. Remember there is a 15% tax on top of the room price. The pictures on the website don't show you enough of the rooms to see what they are really like. Viewing the widely varying comments I can only imagine that the rooms also vary greatly in quality. And our room was considered to be the middle of the line, not their cheapest. Mayby having a balcony would have made all the difference. Hint for all the tourists, take a cab from airport to hotel ~$28 each way. You don't need to rent a car, parking is bad. Buses take you wherever you want to go. Bring your AAA card or student ID, a lot of places will give you a good discount.

<Content>Lovely quaint hotel What can I say? The three of us were advised to go to this hotel after having so much trouble trying to find accomodation in a suitable location, we found out there was a conference in NO the beginning of the week. We had four nights there and had to swap rooms after two nights for a slightly smaller room (we knew this before we booked). If I'm honest after reading some of the reviews I wasn't sure what to expect, we were all very pleasantly surprised the rooms were lovely very homely, nice and clean and all the staff were very friendly no matter what time or what we asked.Can definitley recommend, for what we paid for we got above our expectations. Cannot understand at all why people still complain about a place this nice and this reasonably priced?

<Content>Good hotel but could be better. My husband and I decided to stay here for our first trip to New Orleans in November. The location, price and ambiance were great but I could not help feeling that with a little effort it could have been so much better. The staff was amazing from the time we booked reservations to the end of our stay and the location was everything we could have asked for. I think the balcony was what made our room. We ended up spending every night on it talking while watching people walk by. The elevator was a bit run down but was very European and I kind of liked it's antique charm. The hotel in general could use a little renovation though. Our room seemed continually humid (yes I know this is just part of NO), but we could not get our AC working right. On a few occasions we were kept up by the sound of other people in their rooms. Like a previous person mentioned the plant on our balcony was dead and the pot filled with cigarette butts. If you are willing to overlook a few of these things for the location and quaintness then go for it. If these are the things that really bug you I would find another hotel.

<Content>Great location, however, our room was filthy! After reading other reviews of the Hotel Villa Convento, I looked forward to our stay with much anticipation. The location was great and the price was right, so what could be so wrong?Our room was filthy! The floor in the sink area had a thick accumulation of dust and hair in the corners and the white light fixture over the sink was so caked with dust and dirt, the color was dark gray. In addition, the walls were filthy and stained, badly in need of a fresh coat of paint. Finally, to top it all off, the stench of stale cigarettes was so overwhelming, I got sick to my stomach. (Did I mention the flower pot FULL of cigarette butts just outside our door???)Our bedspread had several rips, as well, and the lamp shades were also caked with dust. I could go on...When I politely pointed this all out to the gal at the front desk, she said I would have to speak with the manager about the light fixture. What??? I tactfully mentioned the only thing needed was a wet rag treatment by the cleaning staff. She acted like I was asking for something unreasonable! So, when the light fixture was still filthy after they cleaned the room, I took one of their towels and cleaned it myself. (It only took ten second!)The bottom line is there appeared to be no pride of ownership. The common areas were dirty, too, so perhaps this hotel has gone down hill since the previous reviews were written.Advice: If you have dust allergies like I do, don't stay at this hotel; especially in room 105. Everything was dusty: the floor, lights, baseboards, lamps and lampshades, ETC.

<Content>Great Hote, Great price! I'll be back! I stayed here when my wife and I decided to go to NO on the spur of the moment. We had no resevvations and as we got there found that there were several conventions. Almost every where we tried was booked. We had a list of numbers from the LA welcome station that we started calling. We got a great walk-in rate for a Saturday night of $59. It was an older smaller hotel that had a real New Orleans flavor. I found it clean with a comfortable bed, helpful staff, good parking and a great location central to everything. I go to NO regularly and stay at a varity of hotels. I will definitly stay there again.

<Content>Good except for elevator This place has a lot going for it but the elevator is to stay away from. It jerks and viabrates and looks, and feels, like a coffin. It jerked me so bad I hit my head on the ceiling. The staff is wonderful and the room with the balcony overlooking the street was excellent. The bakery accros the street, Croissant de Or is worth the cost of missing the free breakfast. Great Location, Courtyard and hallways need a lot of work - stay out of the elevator.

<Content>GREAT PLACE What a quaint inn that is so convenient to the French Quarter yet far enough away. This place has a great staff and is very clean and right across from the town's best coffee and croissants!

<Content>Like Staying with a Friend My husband and I found the Hotel Villa Convento through this website. From the moment we called to make our reservations, we were treated extremely well by the Campo family. The whole experience was exactly what we expected and more. The room looked exactly as the pictures on the website. It had a very uncomplicated layout and was exactly what we needed. The elevator may be small to some, but we found it to be a perfect fit to the entire hotel. This was the first time we stayed in the quarter (an area filled with a rich history) and we found the hotel to be very quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of other parts of the french quarter. We could not hear the other guests staying on either side of us and we got a great night's rest every night. The balcony was my husband's favorite part. One night he even said it was like staying over at a friend's house.

<Content>never again Just got back from a 4 day stay and would definitely not recommned this place. Our room was dirty, the paint peeling and tiles were missing in the moldy bathroom. You have to stand on a chair to adjust the rattling air conditioner. The breakfast had so-so rolls with weak coffee. The pictures on their web site and brochure are nothing like the place. Don't stay here.

<Content>Hotel 'V' was great Stayed here during Labor Day weekend, 2004, and I found the Hotel V was a great hotel for the money. It was within walking distance of everything of interest. Tucked away on one of the less busy streets, it was a great retreat when I wanted to escape the madness and fun of Bourbon Street. While the outside could stand a little attention (i.e paintwork) the room was very nice; I just considered this little flaw part of the ambiance. After all, I didn't go to New Orleans to stay in a hotel room!If you go in knowing you're not staying at the Ritz, but an original old New Orleans brothel, you'll enjoy the stay. If you're wanting your sheets turned down and mints placed on your pillows, you'll need to go elsewhere.

<Content>Hotel Villa Convento was great. My husb. and I recently returned from an 8 day stay at Hotel Villa Convento. Stayed in the 2 suites on top floor  they were charming with plenty of space. It is definitely old New Orleans charm. No frills, but clean, and rooms made up promptly each day. and Jennie at front desk, and Mr. Campo were very informative, cheerful and helpful. Requested extra towel each day with no problem. A big plus - right across the street from Croissant 'd Or - wonderful place to eat. Would stay there again.

<Content>This is a great place! We just stayed at the Villa Convento from 5-6-04 to 5-10-04. It was close to everything, but was situated in a quite part of the French Quarter. Our room was very nice, and the staff was great. We would definitely stay there again. The prices were great also.

<Content>Best Location - Loved It! What a great little family owned and operated hotel. You get a feel of old New Orleans at a great price and fabulous location. Our room was on the second floor, and yes - the elevator was small but sooo cool. The walls of the elevator are done in tapestry! It is no smaller than the lifts in Europe. Just lends to the charm of the place. Our room was small, but clean and the bed was comfortable. We had a balcony where we sat eating muffalattas from the deli down the street one afternoon. It's so close to everything. We didn't have a car and didn't need one. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I'd stay here again and again.

<Content>Great Location !! The price and location are great! I had no problem with my reservation, but others I was with had room mix-ups. Double check your reservation. I recommend a balcony room.

<Content>Great value, safe area A nice, basic, small hotel, owned by a very nice family. No frills. Shabby and a bit run down, but clean. Helpful staff. Good mattresses. Adequate bathrooms. Good room prices. The courtyard could be an absolute gem if they would fix the rotting porch and get rid of the dead plants. Our room had a balcony where we had coffee each morning. The hotel's best feature is that it is in a safe and convenient area, just three blocks from St. Louis Cathedral. I'd stay there again.

<Content>Best Hotel This was my 3rd trip to New Orleans and the best hotel I have stayed at. We stayed 7 nights. The staff was very friendly and quickly responded to anything we needed. Another couple on the trip with us was very pleased as well. It looks as if all rooms have been recently renovated. Ours (and the other couple's) were very clean and looked freshly painted and carpeted. The hotel and area were beautiful and gave you a true sense of what New Orleans was about. I will stay at the Villa Convento in all future trips. It is close to the action, without all of the noise (the best nights of sleep we've gotten in a long time!) and our 3rd floor room (303) had a great view of the New Orleans rooftops and the Ursulines Convent. All this at a low room and parking rate! One of the best kept hotel secrets in New Orleans!

<Content>Lovely Villa Convento Two friends of mine and I stayed at this very charming BB in August. We stayed in one of the top floor suites...with a nice large balcony! Great for people watching or just relaxing with a drink in hand and watching the storms roll in over the city. We could see all over town, as well as the river. It was fun to see and hear the large river and cruise boats floating by! The elevator is a bit scary and slow, but once you get used to it, and realize its a great peice of historical architechture, you dont mind it so much! Their breakfast consists of pastries and yummies from the delicious cafe across the street. The room was nice and spacious, with a living room and a wonderful JET tub! Those bubbles are amazingly invigorating. The hotel is going under major renovations, but its looking good! Also, when we first arrived we had no water for about 30 minutes...but other than that we had a perfect stay. I would definitely return.

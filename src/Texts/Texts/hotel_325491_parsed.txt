<Content>Nice room but sterile place I chose this as a low hassle starting point for my trip to china. It lies in a reasonably central location and is about 10 mins from a line 5 underground station. Probably 15 min walk to the temple of heaven park. The hotel's situation is quite nice, pretty quiet area - not particularly touristy at all.The room was comfortable and of a decent size with a nice powerful shower - albeit a slightly stale shower curtain.The lobby is a bit of an empty cavern and the evening buffet dinner expensive, tired and uninspiring. Breakfast, while quite pricey was good though.There was a bit of a buzz upstairs in the KTV karaoke lounge - but these are private booths and being a lone traveller i didn't hang around long. Taxis cost a shade over 100RMB to and from the airport. It is possible to take the metro and this might be advisable if travelling alone at peak hours since the roads get quite clogged.

<Content>Thanks to tripadvisor I get this fine hotel I was looking for a hotel in Beijing for a 4 night stay at about $100s and found good reviews for this hotel at tripadvisor. I was not deceived! We got a realy nice room, the staff was very professional and the breakfeast was very good. Even if the location is not very central, a 10 minutes walk to the subway station put you everywhere in Beijing. The only point is that smoking is allowed indoors, but it is not a problem specific for this hotel, this is China.

<Content>Loved the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven--Again! In October of 2008, I stayed once again at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven hotel in Beijing. This was my third stay, and I was very pleased, as usual. I stayed on the executive floor for about $100/night and considered it to be a very good deal. Although the hotel does not do a very good job of publicizing it, all executive floor rooms come with an excellent free buffet breakfast, a laundry allowance sufficient to clean a pair of pants and shirt daily, up to six free juices or local soft drinks from the mini-bar, and free coffee, tea and soft drinks all day long in the very pleasant executive lounge. There are also snacks and two free alcoholic drinks daily available in the executive lounge, but only during a designated happy hour period. All in all, I found my hotel experience to be top notch. The room was very clean, the bed linens (and towels, to a slightly lesser extent) were of good quality, and the housekeeping staff did a good job. The concierge staff was very helpful and friendly and the front desk clerks were efficient and pleasant. The employees in the hotel restaurants were particularly customer-oriented--after specially requesting pineapple at the breakfast buffet on my second morning at the hotel, I found it delivered without fail to my table for each subsequent breakfast. In addition, once the staff learned that my sister and traveling companion had a bad cold, they specially fixed her ginger tea and ginger in hot Coca Cola (an established and trusted Chinese cold remedy, apparently) and delivered it to our table. This hotel is really a gem. I will say that my executive floor room was considerably nicer than the one standard room that I visited during my time at the hotel, so I would recommend spending the extra money to upgrade. The location of the hotel may not be the most central, but with the new subway station nearby, it is really easy to access other parts of the city. I found the subway station to be a pleasant 10 minute walk from the hotel, and at 2 RMB per ride, it is a great bargain.Don't miss out on this great Beijing hotel!

<Content>Decent Hotel Option Altogether, the experience you get at this hotel is what you would expect. The service was fine and the rooms were clean and by-the-book. The only real downside was the ludicrously high charge to use the internet in the business center - the worst I experienced during my two weeks in China. The location wasn't amazing, but it's only a 10 minute walk to the nearest subway station, and it should be noted the Beijing subway system is top-notch, so you'll be able to get anywhere you want to go fairly quickly from there.

<Content>Great Value This hotel is a very good value for Beijing. Like everywhere we went in china, though, it was a good value because it wasn't too close to anything. the nearest metro stop was about 4 blocks away. we always managed to find a good pastry shop along the way to the metro. Very clean rooms. They gave us as many complimentary water bottles as we wanted. I would definitely stay here again if i went back to china, despite the location. the staff also was very helpful in telling us how to get to every attraction.

<Content>Really liked the HI Temple of Heaven Very nice hotel. Clean and well appointed. Good facilities. Desk staff spoke very good english. Silver-service in their dining areas. Loved the breakfast! Family friendly. Kids loved the heated pool... although we had to purchase a swim cap (AU$9 each!) Great value for money. Although expect it to be a good half hr drive to where most tourists stay and shop. Cheap taxi's though!

<Content>Excellent Hotel I have just spent 5 days in Beijing staying in this hotel. My family and myself is very happy with this hotel. I will say this is one of the best hotels I experience. First of all, all the staff (reception, restaurant, doorman, even the lady that clean the room) are very friendly, polite and helpful. My daughter got sick on the last day we were there, not only they recommend the hospital that suit our need, they also extend my check out time for two hours so that I can handle the situation comfortably. Frankly saying, I think their service attitude is the best that I have experienced in any country. Everybody work there has very good attitude!!!This hotel has all the facility you will need on a touring trip or business trip. The room is not really fancy but still roomy, clean and comfortable. It has great value and the kids eat free. I especially like the buffet breakfast that they supply. It has both Chinese and Western food and the quality of the food is very good. My kids grow up in Canada and I don鈥檛 have to worry about finding food that fit their diet.I saw some of the reviewer complain about the location. It is a normal residential area for Beijing resident. It is perfectly safe. I personally like this location because I can go to the grocery to buy local snack and bottle water and not paying the premium of the tourist location. I also find a store that sell excellent local pastry. There is also local dry and wet cleaner that can wash the clothing at a very reasonable price (5 RMB/clothing, underwear is done by weight).I realize this hotel is not in the main tourist area. I went downtown where all the action is twice during my visit. Beside that, all the other tourist area is on the outskirt. When I don鈥檛 have to go downtown, I avoid getting there. If you saw the traffic jam of the downtown area, you will understand why I prefer not going there. I cannot imagine going through that traffic everyday if I live there. Since I have two young kids, I am not looking for party every night.I am sure that I will go back to this hotel on my next visit.

<Content>Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven- Great value I stayed at the Holiday Inn- Temple of Heaven at the beginning of June 08 and was pleasantly surprised at how nice of a hotel it was. The lobby is very nice, the staff great and the rooms while not overly large where very clean. I didnt find its location bad at all. Close to the Temple of Heaven and the Pearl Market. Cab rides to other places where also very reasonable. Overall, for the price I thought it was a very good value especially with the included breakfast.

<Content>Amazing hotel, amazing experience The Holiday Inn - Temple of Heaven is by far the best Holiday Inn chain hotel I have ever visited. Unlike HIs in the United States and Canada, the hotel has amazing concierges, friendly staff, spacious rooms and halls, and new furnishings and decorations. The staff was helpful with writing out the chinese characters for all the places we were going, and helped us out getting Z-line trains to Xian with little effort. Furthermore, while the breakfast may be overpriced to some travelers, you have the ability to order a-la-carte, thus having a 5-6 USD breakfast. Overall, the service is what sets this hotel apart.

<Content>Great place to stay ! We booked this hotel through a travel agent, total 9 of us, we enjoyed the stay, the rooms are very comfortable, clean and quiet, the buffet was excellent. You can find anything you can have in Canada. Plus it is in a residential area, you can simply walk to a cornor store to pick up some drink/beers.The service was nice, since we join the local tour, we always were picked up from the hotel, so the location seem perfect for us. We definitely recommend to our friends.

<Content>Clean place My wife and I stayed in this hotel and also at the Holiday Inn in Shanghai (which is much, much better). The rooms were clean, the staff polite and friendly. A woman in the business center was particularly helpful. The breakfast buffet was good. Plus, we got to see how people live since it's in a residential area. Go out for a morning walk and you'll see all sorts of interesting stuff -- including people carrying birds in cages (they are taking the birds out for a change in scenery!).

<Content>A nice Surprise from a picky traveller I usually stay at a 5-star property (China World or Grand Hyatt) but I'm here for just one week on business and didn't need the extra ammenities or price. I reluctantly booked this hotel after reading other reviews and was very pleasantly surprised! The lobby is large and modern, and the location is not bad depending on where you are going. The room (regular not club floor) is average size, good ammenities and a big plus for me...free broadband Internet access. The on-site Heavenly Cafe was also a big surprise great value and great service. My husband and I had 2 beers and 4 dishes for about $10. For regular Beijing travellers who are used to staying in hotels at the $150-250 range this is a welcome budget friendly hotel at 575rmb!.

<Content>Excellent Value Hotel I recently stayed here for 3 nights. I also stayed at the Holiday Inn Central Plaza on my recent visit to China and in comparison i was not disappointed with my stay here. I got what i consider a great room rate for a Suite Room. This included access to the Business Lounge and Breakfast was included.The hotel location is not central, but a short affordable taxi ride will take you to most sites in Beijing.I believe this Hotel is ideal for people visiting Beijing who would like to sample 'local' life. Stepping out of the Hotel you are in a local area and not the 'touristy' areas that most people only see and experience. There are plenty of small eating places and shops close by.My room was a little dated and would need upgraded, but for the cost of the room i consider it was good value for money. I am sure when they upgrade the hotel they will also upgrade the room rate.To conclude i would have no problem recommending this hotel, both for value for money and friendliness of the staff.

<Content>Too expensive for remote location The previous reviews mentioning the location were on the money, this place is remote. Without Chinese I think it would be impossible to get to/from this hotel. No taxi drivers knew the hotel even when I showed them the card, every driver had to call to get directions. Furthermore the traffic is so bad in Beijing that location is key. There are other international brands that have much better locations for the same price.The hotel itself is fine, the service is fine, the rooms are fine, the food is fine. Nothing great. My key complaint is the cost, it is simply too expensive for how average it is and how out of the way.

<Content>Excellent Choice My family and I stayed here for several nights while sightseeing in Beijing. The hotel is clean, the staff professional and the price a bargain (I booked at the Holiday Inn website). Although not in the center of the city, a taxi ride to Wangfujing costs only about 20 yuan (and there are plenty of taxis), and bus 803 goes directly there from a stop immediately behind the hotel for just 1 yuan. My children loved the fairly large indoor pool. The hotel's dinner buffet left something to be desired, but there are plenty of decent Chinese restaurants right out the door. I will definately stay here again when in Beijing.

<Content>Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven, Beijing My husband and I stayed at this hotel as part of our Classic China Tour with Travelscope (50 group members). The hotel was excellent, very clean, the rooms were very luxurious, and the staff were wonderful. I sent a fax to my mother (she is very deaf so it is my only way of communicating) and it was dealt with immediately and for a very low price. My laundry was handed in at 0800 and was returned, washed, ironed and on hangers at 4pm - again for a very reasonable price.I have to follow a gluten free diet, and breakfasts can be difficult, but I was spoilt for choice here, there was so much food of every variety on offer - I certainly did not feel hungry!!If I am ever lucky enough to go back to this wonderful city, I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Very very good value and very helpful friendly staff.

<Content>great value, excelent location We stayed for only 50鈧?including breakfast, and for this money it is the best choice in Beijing. The hotel has a beautiful lobby and restaurant, very comfy and the room, although smallish is well apointed and nice.We also stayed at the Westin and the location of the Holiday Inn is much better. We went walking to the Temple of Heaven, about 20 min. through a very interesting street. It is also not far from the forbidden city and the silk market.It is more than enough if you are looking for a 5star without high-end luxus and service.

<Content>Awesome, but a little overpriced for a guy on a budget This place was great. Biggest problem in China was finding people to understand english. This hotel had an abundance of workers that were able to help.Rooms were very clean and well stocked with everything you could want.It wasnt too far from most attractions, not far from the tennis centre. Taxi's are cheap anyway so you can get around.Unfortunately, compared to the dodgy places, this Hotel was very expensive. around $60 - $70 AUD a night. It was definately worth paying to have some staff who could speak English!

<Content>Loved the Holiday Inn We just got back from two weeks in China. We stayed about 4 nights at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven. It was hard to depart this hotel as the staff was so dedicated to making our stay as comfortable as possible. The hotel room was very clean and very well kept. We felt spoiled each time we got back to the hotel from a day out in the city with a very clean room and access to the reasonable priced 24/7 spa. The breakfast was full of various selections of western and eastern foods to the point that it felt as we had a feast each time we had breakfast. Overall, this hotel is one of the best hotels I鈥檝e stayed for the price we paid. We liked the location as it was very close to the Forbidden City, and the temple of heaven. Another thing we liked about this hotel is that it was located within a neighborhood, which allowed us to get a taste of the everyday lives of the peoples in Beijing. This hotel made our stay in Beijing a memorable one. In fact, when we went on with our trip to other cities, we often talked about how wonderful our stay at the Temple of Heaven hotel was compared to the hotels we stayed in other cities. I would definitively recommend this hotel to others.

<Content>Horrible Location The hotel is new and has a great breakfast buffet. The rooms are nice and it has cable with multiple english channels. HOWEVER, it was a horrible location. I was traveling with my mother and we had an extremely hard time finding a cab that would take back to the hotel from Central Beijing. Overall, I would not stay here again solely because of the location.

<Content>Touring with Teenagers Just stayed in the hotel as part of a tour package. As the other reviewers said, this is an excellent value and great overall holiday. Not in the center of activity, but we were with a group of teenagers who didn't have far to stray as a result. Good facilities, free internet access and refreshing pool in the summer heat.

<Content>Great Hotel! What great rooms I found at the Holiday Inn Temple of Heaven Bejing - at about $68 for a single on the Holiday Inn's website. It was less than the rate quotes direct from the hotel - but it's always great to check all options. It has everything I like when I travel including a decent health club, plus robe and slippers, coffee maker, free high speed internet, and it's bright because of the large windows. They also had a non-smoking floor. The bed was fairly comfortable and had a great silk comforter. Try to buy one when you are in China.The service from the hotel staff was impeccable and very friendly. The restaurant had a good buffet breakfast with everything including omelettes, fresh eggs to order, etc. The dinner buffet was fine - although we didn鈥檛 find a lot of great restaurants generally in China, unless you stay at a 5 star Western Hotel. Since we were picked up by the Tour Company, we found it fine for location. Not too far from the Pearl Market. Will absolutely stay there next time I am in Beijing.

<Content>Impressed Extremely clean, neat and new!!! Excellent choice for the price and the staffs are extremely helpful. Food at the restaurants in the hotel are better than expected and very reasonably priced. The only downside is the location which is a little away from the city centre and half the time the taxi drivers do not know the exact location even with the map of the hotel. Nevertheless, I will recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a very comfortable and clean hotel room to go back to at the end of the day. I have stayed at a supposedly prestigious hotel nearer the city, it is nothing compared to this holiday inn which is at half the price.

<Content>Great place to stay! We were very impressed with this hotel. The place is much nicerthan most Holiday Inns in the Usa. We were greated and assistedwith much care. The location is not the best but the hotel is great.We had a massage for $20. for 45 min. You cannot beat that!There are 3 restaurants. The breakfast buffet was plentiful.A variety of foods from different countries. The taxis are cheap toget to the pearl market. The Temple of Heaven is only a 15min walk.However, I do recommend to travel in a group as you are walkingthrough some areas that are a little scary. We did not have a welcomefeel as we walked through this area. We had a van take our group of 5to the great wall and ming tombs. We were disappointed because theydid not get an English speaking driver for us. So we could not get anydetails....wish we would have taken the English speaking tour instead.For the $75 a night we were very impressed
